# Resources Overview

Welcome to TagoCore's Resources section! This comprehensive guide covers all the essential components and features that make up your TagoCore platform. Whether you're setting up your first device or building complex automation workflows, these resources will help you master every aspect of TagoCore.

## What You'll Find Here

The Resources section is organized into key areas that cover TagoCore's core functionality and system management:

### Core Components

**[Devices](/docs/tagocore/device)**  
Learn how to connect, configure, and manage your IoT devices. Devices are the foundation of your IoT ecosystem - they collect data from sensors, receive commands, and act as the bridge between your physical hardware and TagoCore's digital environment.

**[Analyses](/docs/tagocore/analysis)**  
Discover how to create and manage custom scripts that process your device data in real-time. Analyses enable you to transform raw sensor data, implement business logic, detect patterns, and trigger automated responses based on your specific requirements.

**[Actions](/docs/tagocore/action)**  
Master the automation capabilities that make TagoCore powerful. Actions respond to events in your system by sending notifications, making API calls, running analyses, or integrating with external services - essentially the "then" part of your "if-then" automation rules.

### System Management

**[Home Dashboard](/docs/tagocore/home)**  
Understand your TagoCore dashboard - your central command center that provides system overview, resource summaries, network information, hardware usage metrics, and real-time data flow visualization.

**[Settings](/docs/tagocore/settings)**  
Configure and customize your TagoCore instance. Modify port settings, database plugins, queue plugins, and filesystem plugins to tailor TagoCore to your specific environment and requirements.

**[Logs](/docs/tagocore/log)**  
Monitor and troubleshoot your TagoCore platform. The logging system helps you track system events, debug issues, monitor performance, and maintain operational visibility across all components.

## Getting Started with Resources

If you're new to TagoCore, we recommend following this learning path:

# Live Inspector

The Live Inspector is a real-time monitoring tool that shows you exactly what data is flowing between TagoCore and your [Devices](/docs/tagocore/device). It's perfect for troubleshooting connection issues, testing [Payload Parser scripts](/docs/tagocore/resources/device/payload-parser.md), and watching your device communication in action.

Think of it as a window into your device's communication - you can see every message sent and received, helping you understand what's happening behind the scenes.

## Starting Live Inspector

To start monitoring your device traffic, click the&nbsp; <img src="/docs_imagem/tagocore/device/live-inspector-play-button.png" height="25px" /> &nbsp;button on your device page.

Once activated, the Live Inspector will display all communication in real-time. Every data packet, request, and response will appear on screen as it happens, giving you instant visibility into your device's activity.

:::info Session-Based Monitoring
Live Inspector only works while you have the device page open in your browser. It automatically stops when you close or navigate away from the page.

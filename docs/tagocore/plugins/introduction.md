# Plugins

Plugins are add-on components that expand TagoCore's capabilities beyond its core features. Think of them as apps for your IoT platform - they add new integrations, data sources, storage options, and specialized functionality created by both the TagoCore community and TagoIO team.

Plugins help you customize TagoCore to fit your specific needs without modifying the core system.

## Creating Your Own Plugin

Want to build custom functionality for TagoCore? All plugins are developed using Node.js, making them accessible to JavaScript developers.

Once you've built a plugin, you'll soon be able to share it with the community through the upcoming Plugin Store.

Ready to start? Check out our [Creating Plugins](/docs/tagocore/plugins/create) guide for step-by-step instructions.

## Installing Plugins

**For your own plugins**: If you've developed a custom plugin, use our [Manual Installation](/docs/tagocore/plugins/install/manually.md) guide to add it to your TagoCore instance.

**For community plugins**: The easiest way to discover and install plugins from other developers is through the [Plugin Store](/docs/tagocore/plugins/install/pluginstore.md), where you can browse available plugins and install them with just a few clicks.

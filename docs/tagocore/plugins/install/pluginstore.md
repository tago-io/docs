# Using the Plugin Store

The Plugin Store is your one-stop shop for discovering and enabling new TagoCore functionality. All available plugins are already built into TagoCore - you just need to activate the ones you want to use.

Think of it like enabling features rather than installing new software. All plugin code is already included with your TagoCore installation, so activation is instant and doesn't require downloading anything.

You can browse all available plugins in the [TagoCore plugins repository](https://github.com/tago-io/tagocore/tree/main/plugins).

## Activating a Plugin

Ready to add new functionality to your TagoCore? Here's how to activate a plugin:

1. **Open Plugin Store**: Click the `Plugins` button in TagoCore's sidebar
2. **Choose Your Plugin**: Browse the available plugins and select one that meets your needs
3. **Activate**: Click the `Activate` button on the right side of the page

Once activated, the plugin will immediately be available for use in your TagoCore system.

:::info Compatibility Check
TagoCore automatically prevents you from activating plugins that aren't compatible with your current platform or system configuration.

TagoCore is a free, fast, open-source IoT platform that you can integrate with TagoIO Cloud. TagoCore runs on all major operating systems, on the edge, and on the cloud.

## Integration

You can integrate TagoCore with TagoIO to make the most of your Cloud account and local system. There are several benefits to connecting your TagoIO account to your TagoCore:

- **Orchestrate all instances**  
  You will be able to manage all instances of TagoCore from TagoIO Cloud. Visualize instance summaries, compute usage, and more.

- **Visualize real-time TagoCore data**  
  You can visualize your data in real time without having to store it in TagoIO Cloud.

- **Interact with your instances**  
  Activate actions, rename instances, run analyses that can merge TagoCore and TagoIO data, and perform many other management tasks.

To connect your TagoCore with your TagoIO account, follow [our tutorial](https://docs.tagocore.com/tagocore/getting-started/connect-tagoio) located in the TagoCore documentation center.

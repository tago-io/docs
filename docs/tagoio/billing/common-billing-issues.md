## Why was a charge declined?

Declines can occur for many reasons determined by the cardholder’s bank. Each bank uses a system that considers various signals, such as the cardholder’s spending habits, account balance, and card information like the expiration date and CVV/CVC security number.

Since these signals change over time, a card that was previously successful may be declined for a future charge.

> Even if all card information is correct and the cardholder previously had a successful payment, a future charge can still be declined by the bank.

## Finding out more information about a specific decline

TagoIO displays all information we receive from the cardholder’s bank and the payment processor about a decline in the error message. Because of this, we do not have additional details beyond the error information provided to us.

> If the card information (card number, expiration date, CVV/CVC) is correct but there is still trouble checking out, the cardholder needs to contact their bank.

The cardholder’s bank is the entity declining the charge and sending the error. Therefore, only the bank can explain why the transaction was declined and how to resolve the issue.

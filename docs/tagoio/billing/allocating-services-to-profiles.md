When you manage multiple profiles in your account, ensure each profile has the correct allocation of services so they operate efficiently. You can configure per-profile allocations on the Billing page under the [Resource Allocation](../billing/setup-billing) tab.

The services within each profile can be limited so that when a profile exceeds its allocated limit, only that profile will have its service blocked. If the available services are insufficient for allocation, you can either increase the total service limits for your account or reduce the allocation for other profiles. Access the [Billing](../billing/billing-summary) page to upgrade or change these service limits.

## How to allocate resources
- Open the Billing page and select the Resource Allocation tab.
- For each profile, set the desired limit for each service (for example: Data Input, Data Storage, SMS, E‑mail, Push Notification, File Storage, Run Users, Analysis).
- Save the allocation changes. Each profile will then be limited to the amounts you set.
- If you need more overall capacity, upgrade your account from the Billing page to increase total service limits.
- The interface displays the amount of each service allocated to every profile and lets you view a profile’s usage history for past and current months by clicking the chart icon next to the resource.
- Clicking on a resource opens a new window where you can further customize its allocation.

See [Resource Allocation](../billing/setup-billing) for details on the UI and options available when assigning service quotas to profiles.

## Monitoring allocated resources
- The Resource Allocation view shows usage bars for each service per profile so you can track consumption.
- On the left side, the **Account Service Allocation** column displays the total amounts of each service available for distribution across your account. These are the limits you've set for your entire account; they can be increased by clicking the “Upgrade account limits” button or through the [Billing](../billing/billing-summary) page in the Services tab.
- On the right, the **Profile Usage Allocation** column shows how much of each service has been used by each profile, highlighting which profiles are close to or have reached their limits. Profiles are sorted by those that have reached their limits and those nearing them, helping you quickly identify which may face service disruption.
- Clicking on a resource opens a new window for customizing its allocation.
- You can also manage the limits of your account’s services and allocate profiles directly from your mobile device through the [TagoIO mobile app](../account/managing-your-account-with-the-tagoio-mobile-app).

## When allocations are insufficient
- Increase the account‑wide service limits via the Billing page.
- Or decrease allocations for other profiles to free up resources.
- Choose the option that best fits your account structure and operational needs.

The Formula feature enables users to modify the visualization of data in specific widgets. Located inside the configuration tab of most widgets, a Formula can be applied to all fields of a stored register, including variable, value, unit, series, location, and metadata.

How it works
## How it works
The system receives input data from a variable in your [Device](../devices/devices), applies a formula to generate a temporary output value, and displays that output in the widget. This output is only for visualization and is not saved as a variable in device data storage.

Example flow:
- Input value: 10
- Formula: $value$ * 2 + 5
- Output shown in widget: 25

Example formula (text):
```text
$value$ * 2 + 5
```

Formula configuration in widgets
## Formula configuration in widgets
The Formula configuration is available inside most widget configuration panels. It produces a temporary, visual-only value and does not alter the stored device data.

Typical elements in the Formula panel include:
- Formula mode: Disabled | Simple | Dynamic
- Source: Fixed | Variable
- The formula expression input (for example: ($VALUES$ - 273.15) * 9/5 + 32)
- Unit origin and related unit fields
- "Apply a formula to modify the visualization of each variable" help text and a "Learn more" link

Example formula (temperature conversion):
```text
($VALUES$ - 273.15) * 9/5 + 32
```

Notes
## Notes
- The output generated by a Formula is temporary and only used by the widget for display purposes.
- The original variable and device data remain unchanged by a Formula.
- Formula expressions can reference stored fields like value, unit, series, location, and metadata.

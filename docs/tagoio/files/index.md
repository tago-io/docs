## Overview

File storage is commonly used to send and receive files from devices, store data that is generated by your devices, store images to be displayed in widgets, attach files to emails, or support any other needs you might have for storing files and controlling private or public access to them.

To use the files via **Admin**, go to *Files* in the left menu. From there you can see and manage all the files and folders that are stored on your account, as well as upload new files.

> Developers can use our [SDK](/docs/tagoio/analysis/sdk/) to store and manage files using their applications, upload files from devices, and more.

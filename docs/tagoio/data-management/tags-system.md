Tags are a flexible and powerful way to organize and label your assets within TagoIO. Tags let you manage access and identify key components such as [Devices](link-to-devices), [Actions](link-to-actions), [Analysis](link-to-analysis), [Dashboards](link-to-dashboards), and [Users & Access rules](link-to-users-access).

Operating like keyâ€“value pairs, tags enable you to assign relevant metadata to your assets, such as:
- names
- descriptions
- categories
- locations
- customers
- products
- and more

## 1. How to use tags

Tags can be assigned to a wide range of components within TagoIO. They are typically available through a designated "Tag" tab when configuring assets that support label assignment.

(Example UI: the screenshot shows a "Tags" tab with a table-like interface where you can add a tag key and enter its corresponding value. There are controls to add or remove tag rows and a Save button.)

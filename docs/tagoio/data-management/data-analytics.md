Transform your raw sensor data into actionable insights using visual calculations. Data Analytics enables operations such as averaging, summing, finding maximum and minimum values, and more, directly on your widget variables. This feature also lets you filter data, apply mathematical computations, visualize data as numbers, analyze trends, and perform other data transformations.

Data Analytics is currently available for the widgets listed below, with support for additional widgets to be added in the future:

- [Display](../widgets/display-widget)
- [Line Chart](../widgets/line-chart-widget)
- [Area Chart](../widgets/area-chart-widget)
- [Horizontal Bar](../widgets/horizontal-bar-widget)
- [Vertical Column](../widgets/vertical-column-widget)

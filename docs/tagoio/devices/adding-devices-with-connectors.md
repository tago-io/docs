Connectors enable you to create a [device](./devices) with builtâ€‘in behaviors that allow it to communicate with a network easily.  

When creating devices at TagoIO, there are different ways to allow them to send and receive data through connectors:

1. It can be done directly using MQTT or HTTPS methods with our APIs, where one [Device token](./device-token) per device is required to grant access.
2. When using external services from providers (e.g., LoRaWAN, Sigfox, or cellular), it is necessary to generate an [Authorization](../integrations/connector-overview) per group or application.

That is why you need to select the right connector when creating your device at TagoIO: to take advantage of the integrations already implemented with these services.

## Connector functions

Connectors may provide one or more of the following functions:

- Interface with the [middleware](../middleware/middleware) that connects with the provider when necessary.
- Present logo, name, description, and tags for the device.
- Add [payload parsers](../payload-parser/payload-parser) in the device (optional).

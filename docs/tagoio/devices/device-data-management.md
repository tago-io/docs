The device page provides tools for visualizing, filtering, editing, importing, and exporting variables to facilitate management of the data received from your device. You can access these tools by navigating to the Device module, selecting a device, and clicking on the "Data" tab. Refer to the Device module documentation for navigation details.

## Amount of data records

The amount of data stored in each device is displayed at the top of the page. When the number of data records exceeds 1,000 registers, TagoIO will start to display a truncated value. This represents an estimated number of data records stored in the device.

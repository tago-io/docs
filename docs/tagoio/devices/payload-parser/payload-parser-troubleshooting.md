When using the Payload Parser on TagoIO, you may encounter common problems that stop the parser from decoding your device data correctly. When the parser stops, the data will not be saved on TagoIO. These problems are usually related to mistakes in how the payload parser code is written, but they can be fixed easily.

## Common Issues

### 1. Function Parse Error: Payload Parser Terminated Unexpectedly
This happens when the Payload Parser encounters an error in code that is not formatted correctly and stops working. For example, using a plain string as an error like:
- throw "my error message"

can cause the parser to stop unexpectedly.

Fix:
- Use the proper JavaScript `Error` class when throwing errors. The Payload Parser uses JavaScript, so create errors like this:

```javascript
throw new Error("my correct error message");
```

This method provides a clear and detailed error message, making it easier to identify and fix the problem in your code.

### 2. "your_variable" is Not Defined
This error appears when the Payload Parser tries to use a variable that hasnâ€™t been declared. For example, writing:
- temp = payload.value

without first defining what `temp` is will produce a "not defined" error.

Fix:
- Always declare your variables before use with `const`, `let`, or `var`. This prevents the "not defined" error and avoids creating accidental global variables.
  
Examples of variable declaration:

```javascript
// Example 1
const temp = payload.value;
```

```javascript
// Example 2
let temp = payload.value;
```

```javascript
// Example 3
var temp = payload.value;
```

TagoIO supports two-way communication with devices so they can both send and receive data. Below are the primary options for sending data from your application to a device.

## Methods to send data
- [Publish to MQTT](/docs/tagoio/integrations/networks/mqtt/-publishing-and-subscribing)
- [Post data to an endpoint using HTTP](https://api.docs.tago.io/#operation/postDataHTTP)
- [Create a script](/tagoio/analysis/creating-analysis.md) that runs in the Analysis to access an external API
- Work with our Support Team to build a middleware that will communicate directly with your device using its native protocol Support Team (support@tago.io)

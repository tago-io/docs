The secret key used between TagoIO and your device is called a Device Token. Any access from a device is granted only with a valid token. This token should be kept secret and shared only with people you trust.

> Note: Each time a device is created, the system automatically creates a device token.

## Finding the Device Token

- Open the device in the TagoIO Console (see the Devices documentation for details).
- Go to the "General Information" tab for that device.
- Click the reveal button to show the token.
- You can copy the token by clicking the "Copy token" option.

## Security recommendations

- Treat the device token like a password â€” do not expose it in public repositories, logs, or client-side code.
- Only share the token with systems or people that must interact with the device.

You have the freedom to personalize the look and feel of the RUN interface by crafting your application with a unique color palette and custom assets. To get started, access the [Run module](link-to-run-module) and navigate to the [Theme tab](link-to-theme-tab). The available customization options are described below.

## 1. Signup page

Within the Signup page, you can customize colors, the background, and the displayed logo. You may choose an image, a video, or a solid color for the background. Any adjustments applied to the Signup page will also extend to the Sign-in page.

> **Note:** You can upload the image files for the background and logo on [TagoIO's file storage service](link-to-tagoio-file-storage-service).

## 2. Sidebar & Navigation bar

The Sidebar and the Navigation bar are the main components used to route users through the application.

### 2.1 Sidebar

The Sidebar contains the vertical menu housing your [sidebar buttons](link-to-sidebar-buttons) and the dashboard list. Personalizing the background color ensures that icons and text automatically adapt their colors for optimal contrast and readability.

### 2.2 Navigation bar

The Navigation bar is the top horizontal menu that displays the logo, notifications and the account menu. (Remaining content not visible in the provided screenshot.)

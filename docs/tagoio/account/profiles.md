Profiles are similar to having different sub-accounts under your main account. You can create multiple profiles for people or organizations and share them with others. By doing this, you remain the owner of each "sub-account" while allowing others to access each profile separately.

## Benefits of Profiles

1. Isolate applications from different customers  
   If you have two profiles and one reaches its service limits, only that profile will be impacted or blocked; the other will remain unaffected.

2. Grant restricted access for external individuals  
   Allow external users limited access to specific applications and organizations.

3. Track cost of individual applications and customers  
   Visualize cost breakdown per Profile and Services on the [Statistics](../billing/billing-summary) page.

## Switching Profiles

To switch profiles, click the current profile shown on the top left and select another one.

## Transferring Profiles Between TagoIO Accounts

Once you request a transfer, our support team will assist you with the next steps. When you submit a profile transfer request, a support ticket is automatically created, and our team will contact you by email to confirm required information and prerequisites before proceeding with the transfer. The process is manual and may take a few hours to complete.

Profile transfer is available for Starter and Scale accounts. Check the pricing page for more information: https://tago.io/pricing/

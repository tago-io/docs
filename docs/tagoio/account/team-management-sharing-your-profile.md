You can grant access to other TagoIO accounts to any of your [Profiles](../account/profiles) by using the Team feature. By adding other accounts to your team, they will have access to all applications that run on that Profile.

## Invitation notification
The invitation can only be sent to email addresses that already have a TagoIO account. If the invited user doesn't have an account, the invitation email will guide them to create one.

## Plan limits
The number of members you can invite to a Profile depends on your current plan. Check the list of features and limits available for each plan [here](../billing/account-plans).

## Removing access
You can remove any granted access at any time by removing the user's email from the team members list.

> Only the owner of the [Profile](../account/profiles) is able to invite members.

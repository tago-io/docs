Account Tokens are the secret keys used between Tago and external applications. Any access from an account requires a valid token, so it is vital that tokens are kept secret and only shared with trusted parties.

> ⚠️ All sorts of requests can be performed with Account Tokens, so only provide this token to trusted applications.

## Managing Account Tokens

Account tokens can be managed from your [account details](link-to-account-details) by selecting your profile. You can copy a token by clicking the **Copy** button.

More than one token can be created for the same profile. Permissions and expiration dates for each token may be configured as needed.

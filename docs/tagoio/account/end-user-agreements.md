End-User Agreements is a feature designed to help you manage and track legal agreements or terms of service that users must accept before accessing the platform. This feature ensures compliance and provides a transparent method for maintaining records of user consent. Once implemented, users are prompted to review and accept these agreements during their initial login or whenever new agreements are introduced.

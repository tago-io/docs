A great feature of TagoIO is its native sharing capability for dashboards â€” useful when a dashboard becomes a feature you want to share with others.

> If you want to share only the template of your dashboards, use the [Distribute](link-to-distribute) feature.

> To share applications with your end-users using your brand and a custom URL, use [TagoRUN](link-to-tagorun).

## Share Public

To share a dashboard, open the menu for the dashboard you want to share and click on "Share Public". Example:

<!-- Image placeholder removed for build -->

The Share Public section can also be accessed from the dashboard settings page when viewing the dashboard in your Admin.

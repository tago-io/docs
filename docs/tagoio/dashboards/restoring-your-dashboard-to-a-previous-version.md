In TagoIO Admin, each time you make changes to your dashboards and widgets, the system automatically generates a backup version of each action taken. This ensures you can revert to a previous version of your dashboard if you encounter issues or want to undo recent modifications.

## Accessing the restore option
To access the restore feature, open your dashboard in edit mode and click the "Restore dashboard to a previous version" button.

## Choosing and restoring a version
A chronological list of your dashboard versions will appear, with each entry timestamped so you can identify when each backup was created. Select the desired version from the list and proceed to restore it.

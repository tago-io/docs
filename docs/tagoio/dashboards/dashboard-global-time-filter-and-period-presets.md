## Overview
The Dashboard Period Preset allows users to set global time-based filters that apply across all widgets in a dashboard. This enables effortless comparison of data across different periods, providing valuable insights and facilitating better decision-making.

With the Dashboard Period Preset, users can create filters in the dashboard navigation to select various time periods for all widgets. For example, comparing data from this month to the previous month is achievable in just a few clicks. The feature is highly flexible and provides quick presets for relative dates such as "this week," "this quarter," "today," and more.

When enabled, a date picker is available to choose specific date ranges. You can also define a maximum period range that limits how large a range users can select in the date picker.

## Overview
The Dashboard Period Preset allows users to set global time-based filters that apply across all widgets in a dashboard. This enables effortless comparison of data across different periods, providing valuable insights and facilitating better decision-making.

With the Dashboard Period Preset, users can create filters in the dashboard navigation to select various time periods for all widgets. For example, comparing data from this month to the previous month is achievable in just a few clicks. The feature is highly flexible and provides quick presets for relative dates such as "this week," "this quarter," "today," and more.

When enabled, a date picker is available to choose specific date ranges. You can also define a maximum period range that limits how large a range users can select in the date picker.

## How to apply global time-filters to your dashboards
You can enable the date picker and define preset periods by accessing your dashboard settings. In the General tab, find the **Dashboard Period Preset** configuration. Switch the slider to activate it. Once active, you will be able to define a maximum period range to be filtered and set preset periods that can be quickly selected in the date picker.

### Applying a maximum period range to your date picker
You can define a maximum period for date selection, ensuring that users cannot filter data beyond the specified period range. You still have the flexibility to set preset periods that exceed this maximum range, allowing for broader default selections if necessary.

### Setting period presets
You can set period presets to allow users to easily change the filter range by selecting predefined periods. These periods are defined by you and can be accessed when users click on the calendar icon. You can choose from several periods, create up to five presets, and designate one of them as the default.

### Disabling the Dashboard Period Preset for a single widget
If you want to disable the Dashboard Period Preset for a specific widget, enable the **Override Dashboard Presets** option for widgets that have their own preset period (e.g., Line Chart, Area Chart, Map).

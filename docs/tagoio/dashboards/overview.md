# Dashboard Overview

Dashboards are the visual interface layer of your IoT solutions, allowing you to display real-time data, create interactive controls, and provide user-friendly interfaces for your applications. They serve as the primary way users interact with your IoT data and devices.

## What are Dashboards?

A TagoIO dashboard is a customizable interface that combines multiple widgets to display device data, provide controls, and create complete user experiences. Dashboards can be:

- **Data visualization interfaces** - Charts, graphs, and displays
- **Control panels** - Interactive controls for devices and systems  
- **Monitoring screens** - Real-time status and alerts
- **Public displays** - Shared interfaces for stakeholders
- **Mobile-optimized views** - Responsive designs for mobile devices

3. **Add Widgets**
   - Use the widget library to add visual elements
   - Configure data sources for each widget
   - Customize appearance and behavior

4. **Layout and Design**
   - Arrange widgets using the drag-and-drop interface
   - Adjust sizes and positions for optimal viewing
   - Apply styling and branding elements

5. **Test and Publish**
   - Preview your dashboard with live data
   - Test interactive elements and controls
   - Publish when ready for use

### Advanced Configuration

- **Access Control**: Set viewing and editing permissions
- **URL Parameters**: Create dynamic dashboards with parameters
- **Custom CSS**: Apply advanced styling and branding
- **Integration**: Connect with external services and APIs

## Dashboard Management

### Organization and Structure
- Use descriptive naming conventions
- Organize dashboards into logical groups
- Create dashboard hierarchies for complex applications
- Maintain version control for critical dashboards

### Sharing and Permissions
- **Public Dashboards**: Share with external users without login
- **User-specific Access**: Control who can view or edit dashboards
- **Read-only Access**: Provide viewing rights without editing capabilities
- **Administrative Controls**: Manage dashboard permissions centrally

### Performance Optimization
- **Widget Optimization**: Use appropriate widget types for data volume
- **Data Filtering**: Implement filters to reduce data loading
- **Update Intervals**: Balance real-time needs with performance
- **Caching Strategies**: Leverage TagoIO's caching mechanisms

## Widget Integration

Dashboards serve as containers for widgets, which are the individual components that display data and provide functionality:

### Widget Categories
- **Display Widgets**: Show data values, status, and information
- **Chart Widgets**: Visualize data trends and patterns
- **Input Widgets**: Collect user input and control devices
- **Map Widgets**: Display location-based data and tracking
- **Custom Widgets**: Advanced customizations with HTML/CSS/JavaScript

### Data Binding
- Connect widgets to specific devices and variables
- Configure data formatting and units
- Set up real-time data subscriptions
- Implement data filtering and aggregation

## Best Practices

### Design Guidelines
- **Clarity**: Keep interfaces clean and uncluttered
- **Consistency**: Use consistent styling and layouts
- **Hierarchy**: Organize information with clear visual hierarchy
- **Accessibility**: Design for users with different abilities

### Performance Considerations
- **Data Efficiency**: Only load necessary data for each widget
- **Update Frequency**: Balance real-time needs with system load
- **Widget Selection**: Choose appropriate widgets for data types
- **Device Limits**: Consider device capabilities when designing

### Security and Access
- **Permission Management**: Implement proper access controls
- **Data Sensitivity**: Protect sensitive information appropriately
- **Public Sharing**: Be cautious when sharing dashboards publicly
- **User Authentication**: Ensure proper user authentication for private data

### Maintenance and Updates
- **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review and update dashboards
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track dashboard loading times and usage
- **User Feedback**: Gather feedback from dashboard users
- **Version Control**: Maintain backups of critical dashboards

## Dashboard Limitations

### Technical Limits
- Maximum of 150 widgets per dashboard
- Widget positioning limited to grid system
- Custom CSS restrictions for security
- Browser compatibility considerations

### Data Limits
- Real-time update frequencies are rate-limited
- Historical data display depends on data retention
- Concurrent user limits may apply
- API rate limits affect data refresh rates

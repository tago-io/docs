# Dashboard Overview

A dashboard is where you place your widgets to visualize and interact with data, all in real-time. Dashboards can also be shared with end-users that will access your application using [TagoRUN](/tagorun/tagorun).

All your dashboards are listed on the sidebar of the screen. On the top right you will find the **Edit Dashboard** menu. From there you will have access to other dashboard functionalities such as **rename**, **share, distribute, duplicate,** and **delete**.

There are two types of dashboards:

- **Normal**: simply create a dashboard for pre-selected devices and variables.
- [**Blueprint**](/tagoio/blueprint-dashboard): create dashboards by associating **tags** to scale up your application. One single dashboard can be used with multiple devices and users.

## Building dashboards

To create a new dashboard, start by clicking the **+** button on the left side of Admin page. A new window will appear, giving you the option to either build a dashboard from scratch or choose from one of the pre-designed [templates](/tagoio/distributing-dashboards).

In this window, you can also switch the **Blueprint slider** to generate a Blueprint dashboard instead of a Normal one. Simply enter a name for your new dashboard and click **Save** to begin adding [Widgets](https://help.tago.io/portal/en/kb/tagoio/9-widgets).

## Dashboard Icons

You can add [icons](/tagoio/dashboard-icons) to your dashboard, making it look just the way that you want it.

You can also edit the background color of the dashboards, or add images and animations. Click on the **clog** icon to edit the configurations inside the 'General information' tab.

Although video formats are not accepted, you can upload animations using the **.gif** format as shown below. Images can be uploaded into our [Files](/tagoio/files).

> **Tip:** You have full control of the opacity level for the background and the widgets.

## Reordering widgets for mobile app on TagoRUN

When accessing dashboards through the [TagoRUN app](/tagorun/tagorun-mobile-app), widgets appear in the sequence of their creation by default. To modify this arrangement, simply switch your dashboard to **Edit mode** and click on the small smartphone icon located at right top corner.

To reorder the widgets for the mobile app, just drag them to your preferred position. The adjustments will take effect immediately, although you might need to refresh the dashboard on the mobile app to see the changes.

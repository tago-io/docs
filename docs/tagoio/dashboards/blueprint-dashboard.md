Blueprint is a type of [Dashboard](/docs/tagoio/dashboards/) that allows users to dynamically link [widgets](/docs/tagoio/widgets/) to multiple devices. This type of dashboard is especially useful when scaling applications.

This type of dashboard is extremely useful when scaling up applications.

## Concepts

Blueprint works by allowing users to change the devices associated with widgets in real time inside the Dashboard. These dynamic devices are called Blueprint Devices; you can learn more about them in the following sections of this article.

This means that you can distribute the same Dashboard to hundreds of different TagoRun Users and each one would see their own data inside of the Dashboard.

### Blueprint Devices

[Blueprint Devices](/docs/tagoio/devices/blueprint-devices-entities.md) are dynamic devices that can be changed by the User while viewing the Dashboard. Changing these devices will reload the data for the Widgets that use them.

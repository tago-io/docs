TagoIO will notify you when something needs your attention. You may need to perform an action depending on the type of notification.

## Types of notifications
There are four types of notifications:

- Applications  
  Sent by a customized script triggered by an Analysis. Examples: "Two trucks are out of route", "Your refrigerator temperature is higher than 36 Â°F".

- Other users  
  Displayed when another user shares something with you. Example: "John wishes to share a Dashboard with you."

- Tago system  
  Used by the TagoIO backend to notify users about the system or your account. Example: "There is a new application in the Healthcare industry that you may be interested in."

- TagoRUN User  
  Notifications sent to users registered in your account's User Management. Only your account (or authorized users) can send notifications to these users. Learn more in [Run Users Notifications](../notifications/notifications-for-users).

## Viewing notifications
When you log in to your account, you can see all your notifications in the top-right corner of the admin page.

> The number in red indicates how many new notifications you have. If you have more than 99 notifications, it will display as "99+".

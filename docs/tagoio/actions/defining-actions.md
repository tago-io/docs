Actions are initiated based on specific conditions and can execute a variety of tasks. The first step in configuring an Action is to specify the desired action. Below are the different types of actions available:

## Push Notification to myself

This action can notify you on your account via the Admin (https://admin.tago.io/) in your browser or through the TagoIO app. You can customize the title and content of the notification. In the message field, you can use variables to dynamically include information in your text. For more details on how to use message variables, refer to the "Message Variables" section at the end of this page.

Please note that the notification is only sent to the account where it was created.

Actions is a powerful feature that gives you total control over your devices by executing operations based on events you define.

With Actions you can:
- Send an SMS based on certain conditions.
- Send an email based on certain conditions.
- Run scripts using [Analysis](link-to-analysis).
- Make HTTP POST requests.
- Send notifications to your account or to the account of your [RunUsers](link-to-runusers).
- Publish to an MQTT topic based on certain conditions.

Learn about [Defining Actions](link-to-defining-actions).

## Creating Actions

To create a new Action, click the "Action" button in the sidebar, then click the + button in the top right.

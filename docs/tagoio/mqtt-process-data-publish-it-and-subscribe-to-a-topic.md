In this tutorial, you will learn how to process data, publish to a topic, and subscribe to it. The tutorial uses the MQTTX client throughout.

## Connecting to TagoIO MQTT Broker

To publish a topic via TagoIO's MQTT, you must first add a device.

- Navigate to the "Devices" module in your Admin panel and create a new device. You may choose any connector you prefer; it will not make a difference.
- After creating the device, open the device's "General Information" tab and locate the tokens section.
- Copy your device token from the tokens section â€” this token is required to authenticate when publishing or subscribing via the TagoIO MQTT broker.

(If the tutorial referenced the MQTTX client, that is a third-party MQTT client application commonly used to publish/subscribe for testing; search for "MQTTX" to download or learn more. The "Read more" link in the alert points to the announcement about changes to free account MQTT broker availability.)

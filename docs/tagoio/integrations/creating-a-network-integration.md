## Create a new integration

To create a new integration, go to the [Network management page](link-to-network-management-page) and press the Add network button on the right side of the page:

![Add network button](/docs_imagem/tagoio/creating-a-network-integration-2.png)

You only need to specify the network's name. For example, enter the name and click "Create my Network":

![Add Network dialog where you enter the network name and press Create my Network](/docs_imagem/tagoio/creating-a-network-integration-2.png)

Once the network is created, you can configure several optional parameters. If you want to keep the network private to your account, you do not need to fill in all fields.

## Parameters

- **Name:** Network name.
- **Description:** Network description.
- **Documentation Link:** External link to documentation on how to use the network. Preferably link to TagoIO's community page.
- **Icon:** Icon for the network, shown in the sidebar.
- **Banner:** Banner image for the network, shown when the network is selected.

> After you create a network, it will only be visible to you by default. However, you have the option to share it

## Tips

- Only the network name is required to create the integration; all other fields are optional.
- Use the Documentation Link to point users to implementation details or community resources.

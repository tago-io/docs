## Overview

TagoIO provides many pre-integrated devices and networks so you can quickly connect devices. When a new device or network is not yet integrated, you can create a custom Connector or network integration. Those custom solutions can be shared with members of your team or with any external Profile for their use.

(Links in the original article: [Connector](link-to-connector), [network integration](link-to-network-integration), [Profile](link-to-profile).)

## Sharing a custom Connector or Network

To share a custom Connector or Network with another Profile:

1. Go to the Integrations page. (See [Integrations page](link-to-integrations).)
2. Select the connector or network you want to share.
3. Open the Share tab.
4. Enter the Profile ID of the person you want to share it with.
5. Click the Share button.

Note: Profiles with access to the shared connector cannot modify it; they can only use it to create devices.

The Share modal contains:
- Title: "Share connector"
- Input: "Profile ID" (field to enter the Profile ID to share this connector)
- Small note: "Profiles with access to the shared connector cannot modify it, only use it to create devices."
- Buttons: "Cancel" and "Share"

## Making a connector or network public

If you want your connector or network to be accessible to all TagoIO users, you can request to make it public. Public connectors are subject to a review process. To request publication, go to the Integrations page and click "Submit connector".

Sigfox is a relatively low-cost wireless network technology that requires low
power to connect and is implemented by low-cost hardware modules.

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to integrate Sigfox with the TagoIO
platform. By following these instructions, you will enable uplink and downlink
operations, allowing data exchange between your Sigfox devices and the TagoIO
application.

Uplink is the process of sending data from the devices to TagoIO. Downlink is
used to send data back to the devices. Learn how to perform
[downlink for SigFox](/docs/tagoio/integrations/networks/sigfox/sigfox-downlink.md).

Follow these steps to set up the Sigfox backend and TagoIO.

## Step 1: Create Authorization in TagoIO

1. **Access Authorizations** Go to the _Devices_ section of your TagoIO account.

2. **Create a New Authorization**
   - Click the **Create Authorization** button.
   - Provide a meaningful name for the authorization (e.g.,
     `Sigfox-Integration`).
   - Click **Save**.

3. **Copy the Authorization Token** After creation, copy the authorization
   token; you will need this in later steps.

> The Authorization should be generated by TagoIO by accessing the
> [Service Authorization](https://admin.tago.io/devices/authorization) page; no
> additional parameters are needed.

## Step 2: Set Up Integration in Sigfox

On the Sigfox Backend Portal, create a **callback** of type `uplink`. We will
use the **Data Uplink** option to obtain the basic information in the messages.
If your contract with Sigfox allows you to get more information like RSSI, SNR,
STATION, you can use the
[Advanced Data option](/docs/tagoio/integrations/networks/sigfox/sigfox-using-advanced-data.md).

1. **Create a new callback** Go to your Sigfox console and create a new callback
   under the menu: `Device Type > Callback > New > Custom Callback`.

2. **Configure the Callback**

| Field           | Description                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type**        | Data & Uplink                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Channel URL** | Use the endpoint format `https://sigfox.middleware.REGION.tago.io/uplink`. Replace `REGION` with your deployment region (e.g., `eu-w1`).                       |
| **HTTP Method** | POST                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Send SNI**    | Check the box _Send SNI (Server Name Indication) for SSL/TLS connections_                                                                                      |
| **Headers**     | Add the following headers:<br/>• `authorization`: `<your authorization token from TagoIO>`<br/>• `device`: `{device}`<br/>• `Content-Type`: `application/json` |
| **Body**        | Copy and paste the JSON text below.                                                                                                                            |

```json
[
   {
      "variable": "device",
      "value": "{device}",
      "serie": "{time}"
   },
   {
      "variable": "data",
      "value": "{data}",
      "serie": "{time}"
   },
   {
      "variable": "seqNumber",
      "value": "{seqNumber}",
      "serie": "{time}"
   }
]
```

## Step 3: Add Device in TagoIO

To integrate your device with the TagoIO Platform, follow these guidelines:

1. **Ensure Device EUI Consistency**
   - When creating the device in TagoIO, use the _exact same Device EUI_ that is
     configured in Sigfox.
   - The Device EUI must match exactly to establish a successful connection
     between Sigfox and TagoIO.

2. **Select the Appropriate Network and Device Type**
   - Choose the **Sigfox Network** during the device setup process.
   - Select the correct device type from the available options. If your device
     is not listed, you can add support through connectors.

3. **Add Device Support via Connectors (If Necessary)**
   - If your device type is not available in the default list, enhance its
     compatibility by utilizing connectors.
   - For more information on available connectors and how to use them, refer to
     the
     [Connector Overview](/docs/tagoio/devices/payload-parser/connector/connector-overview.md).

For detailed instructions on adding devices, visit the
[Adding Devices](/docs/tagoio/devices/) page.

## Finalizing Setup

1. **Power On Your Devices** Turn on your Sigfox device and gateway to initiate
   data transmission.

2. **Verify Data Reception**
   - In TagoIO, navigate to the _Device_ and into the _Data_ tab to confirm that
     data is being received.
   - Alternatively, use the
     [Live Inspector](/docs/tagoio/devices/live-inspector.md) within your device
     settings to monitor incoming data in real‑time.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with your Sigfox integration, check the callback logs in
the Sigfox Backend Portal. Common error codes and their solutions:

### Error 401 - Unauthorized

This error indicates an authentication problem:

- **Invalid Authorization Token**: Verify that you copied the correct
  authorization token from TagoIO and pasted it exactly in the `authorization`
  header (without extra spaces or characters).
- **Wrong Region**: Ensure the `REGION` in your callback URL matches your TagoIO
  deployment region. For example, if your TagoIO account is in Europe, use
  `eu-w1`; for US East, use `us-e1`.
- **Expired or Deleted Authorization**: Check if the authorization still exists
  in your TagoIO account at the
  [Service Authorization](https://admin.tago.io/devices/authorization) page.

### Error 400 - Bad Request

This error typically indicates a data format or processing issue:

- **Invalid JSON Body**: Verify that the JSON body in your callback matches the
  format shown in Step 2. Ensure all brackets, quotes, and commas are correct.
- **Content-Type Header Missing**: Confirm that the
  `Content-Type:
  application/json` header is set in your callback
  configuration.
- **Payload Parser Error**: If you're using a custom payload parser, there may
  be an issue with your parsing script. Check the device's
  [Live Inspector](/docs/tagoio/devices/live-inspector.md) to see detailed error
  messages about payload parsing failures.

### No Data Received

If the callback succeeds (HTTP 200) but no data appears in TagoIO:

- **Device EUI Mismatch**: Verify that the Device EUI in TagoIO exactly matches
  the device ID in Sigfox (case-sensitive).
- **Check Live Inspector**: Use the
  [Live Inspector](/docs/tagoio/devices/live-inspector.md) to see if data is
  arriving but being rejected or filtered.

Information about Downlink can be found at the
[Sigfox - Downlink](/docs/tagoio/integrations/networks/sigfox/sigfox-downlink.md)
documentation.

You also can
[create your own parse scripts](/docs/tagoio/devices/payload-parser/building-your-own-parser.md)
to process variables from the payload.

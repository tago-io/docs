Using this article, you will learn how to integrate a LoRaWAN device with the Senet Network and TagoIO.

> Note: This setup is for the uplink operation â€” data sent from the device to your TagoIO account.

The integration is accomplished in two parts:
1) TagoIO Setup  
2) Senet Portal Setup

## 1) TagoIO Setup

First, go to the [Devices](/docs/tagoio/devices/) module in our admin, look for Senet, and select it.

### Create Device

Type a name for your device, select a **[data storage type](/docs/tagoio/devices/)** and define a **[Data Retention](/docs/tagoio/devices/data-management/data-retention-feature)**, then click on *Create device*.

### Generate Service Authorization

You will need to generate an **Authorization** at TagoIO so that it can be added into the Senet integration area.  
This authorization can be generated by accessing the **[Service Authorization](https://admin.tago.io/devices/authorization)** page.

> The generation of an authorization code is crucial for being able to send downlinks since it allows TagoIO to authenticate downlinks.

## 2) Senet Portal Setup

Now, log in to **[Senet portal](http://portal.senetco.io/)** and go to your devices.  
Choose the device to connect to TagoIO and click on the gear icon.

Go to **"Notification Target"**. Make sure the status is *Enabled*, select **HTTP** in the 'forward to' field, and fill the fields accordingly:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | Enter a unique identifier (e.g., `tagoio-integration`). |
| **Forward To HTTP URL** | Use the endpoint format `https://senet.middleware.REGION.tago.io`. Replace `REGION` with your deployment region (e.g., `us-e1`, `eu-w1`). For a list of available regions, visit **[TagoIO Network Integration](/docs/tagoio/integrations/network-integration)**. |
| **Headers** | Add a header key `Authorization` and set its value to the authorization token you copied in Step 1. |
| **Optional Data Fields** | Enable *RF Data* and any other optional field you would like to receive in your device. |

### Setting up Downlink

In order to support downlinks from TagoIO to Senet, you need an additional step.

1. At the **[Senet portal](http://portal.senetco.io/)**, go to your **[Account Settings](https://portal.senetco.io/#/user)**, generate a *Developer API Key* and copy it.
2. Now go back to the **[Authorization](https://admin.tago.io/devices/authorization)** page where you created your authorization in Step 1.
3. Click to edit the **Additional Parameters** of the Authorization.
4. Paste your Developer API Key and press *Save*.

Now you are all set; every time your device sends data to Senet, your data will be available at TagoIO.

> **Note:** TagoIO MQTT Broker is available exclusively for Starter and Scale accounts in the US database region. Free accounts and accounts in the European database region may use thirdâ€‘party MQTT services with TagoIO via the MQTT Relay feature (see the [MQTT Relay documentation](mqtt)).

TagoIO's MQTT broker does not natively support the standard MQTT **retain** feature. However, you can implement an equivalent workaround by using TagoIO Analysis and Actions to store the last message published to a topic and resend it when a new client subscribes.

This approach involves using the [Analysis](../../../analysis/index) and [Actions](../../../actions/index) features to store the last message published to a topic and then resend it when a new client subscribes.

## Setting Up Message on Subscribing

To build an MQTT **retain** workaround with TagoIO, you can either publish directly to a topic with an Action or use an Analysis script for more complex scenarios.

## Using Actions to Publish a Message to a Subscriber

1. **Create an Action**  
   - Navigate to the Actions section in your TagoIO dashboard and create a new action.  
   - Choose the event that will trigger this action. It could be a variable update, a scheduled time, or another custom trigger.

2. **Configure MQTT Publish**  
   - In the action configuration, select **"MQTT Publish"** as the action type.  
   - Specify the topic you wish to publish to and the message payload.

## Using Analysis for Advanced Scenarios

For scenarios where you need to publish for a large number of devices/topics and also require more control over the publishing process, you can use an Analysis script.

### 1. Create an Analysis
- Go to the **Analysis** section and create a new analysis.  
- Choose **Node.js** as the environment.

### 2. Implement MQTT Publish Script

```js
const { Analysis, Services } = require("@tago-io/sdk");

async function mqttPushExample(context, scope) {
  // Create your data object to push to MQTT
  const myDataObject = {
    variable: "temperature_celsius",
    value: (myData.value - 32) * (5 / 9),
    unit: "C",
  };

  // Options for the publish
  const options = { qos: 0 };

  // Publishing to MQTT
  const MQTT = new Services({ token: context.token }).MQTT;
  await MQTT.publish({
    bucket: myData.device,          // for immutable/mutable devices
    message: JSON.stringify(myDataObject),
    topic: "tago/my_topic",
    options,
  });
}

module.exports = new Analysis(mqttPushExample);
```

### 3. Trigger Analysis
- Configure an Action or another event to trigger the execution of your Analysis (e.g., a device update, a scheduled time, or any other event in your TagoIO application).

Refer to the [Analysis documentation](../../../analysis/index) for details on creating scripts and integrating them with Actions and MQTT.

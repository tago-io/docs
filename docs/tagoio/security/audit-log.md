## Overview

The Audit Log is a chronological sequence of entries generated by activities performed by a Profile owned by your account. Audit logs show what happened before and after an event and help identify records associated with specific events.

You can monitor activities such as the addition and deletion of a Device (see [Device](link-to-device-documentation)), changes in Access Management policies (see [Access Management](link-to-access-management-documentation)), Analysis (see [Analysis](link-to-analysis-documentation)), and other similar actions.

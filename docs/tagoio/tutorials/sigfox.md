Sigfox is a relatively low-cost wireless network technology that requires low power to connect and is implemented by low-cost hardware modules.

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to integrate Sigfox with the TagoIO platform. By following these instructions, you will enable uplink and downlink operations, allowing data exchange between your Sigfox devices and the TagoIO application.

Uplink is the process of sending data from the devices to TagoIO. Downlink is used to send data back to the devices. Learn how to perform [downlink for SigFox](link-to-downlink-for-sigfox).

Follow these steps to set up the Sigfox backend and TagoIO.

Follow these steps in order to integrate your devices. You may skip some steps depending on your situation. For example, if you have already generated an authorization and added it to machineQ, you can skip to Step 4.

## On this page
- Step 1: Generate an Application at machineQ
- Step 2: Create Authorization in TagoIO
- Step 3: Add Integration to machineQ
- Step 4: Add Device in TagoIO
- Finalizing Setup

## Step 1: Generate an Application at machineQ

First, make sure you create an Application in machineQ Central so that the integration with TagoIO can be authorized.

Go to your machineQ Central, and follow [this machineQ tutorial](https://www.machineq.com/documentation) to generate a Client ID and a Client Secret that you will need to input in TagoIO later.

## Notes and quick links
- If you already have an authorization created and added to machineQ, you can skip Steps 2–3 and proceed to Step 4.
- Where the article refers to "devices" or "authorization", those are links to the corresponding TagoIO documentation sections:
  - [devices](../devices/devices)
  - [authorization](../security/authorization)

The Control Tower is an add-on designed to enhance your profile by providing access to features that increase your visibility and control over data input and output. It also offers advanced statistics on the usage of your Hard Limits (Rate Limits). By using Control Tower, you can:

- View data input and output statistics for each device.
- Set data input and output limits for each individual device or for the whole profile.
- Visualize Hard Limits usage statistics to gain insights into your requests per minute.

These features let you obtain comprehensive information about your device's activities and the consumption of your Hard Limits. That understanding of your application's performance helps you prevent reaching limits that could interrupt your application's operation due to account limitations. Control Tower was developed to improve the reliability, scalability, and efficiency of your application.

Activate the Control Tower add-on on your [Billing page](../billing/account-plans), or check out our [Pricing Page](https://tago.io/pricing).

## View your device statistics

Once you activate Control Tower, you can view data input and output statistics for each device under your profile. This helps you better understand how much data is being streamed to and from your devices.

You can monitor the statistics by going to your Devices module on your Admin and selecting the device you want to visualize:

Use the [Files](/docs/tagoio/files) module to store any type of file (reports, videos, logos, background images, and more). File service usage is measured by the total size of all files stored across your profiles.

 If any profile reaches its allocated storage limit, the system will block adding new files to that profile.

## Increasing the limit
You can increase the File service limit by [Allocating Resources to profiles](/docs/tagoio/my-account/billing/allocating-services-to-profiles).

## Pricing and FAQ
More information about pricing and frequently asked questions is available on the [Pricing Page](https://tago.io/pricing).

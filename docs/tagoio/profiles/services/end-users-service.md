Each end-user added to the [User Management](/docs/tagoio/tagorun/getting-started/user-management.md) list is counted as an end‑user. End-users (also called RUN‑users) can be added automatically when they sign up in your RUN application.

## Limits and behavior

If any profile reaches the limit of end‑users allocated to it, the system will block the addition of new users.

When a profile hits its allocated end‑user limit, no additional users can be added under that profile until the limit is increased.

## Increasing end-user capacity

Increase the number of end‑users allowed in your application by [Allocating Resources to profiles](/docs/tagoio/my-account/billing/allocating-services-to-profiles.md).

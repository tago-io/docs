Profiles are similar to having different sub-accounts under your main account. You can create multiple profiles for people or organizations and share them with others. By doing this, you remain the owner of each "sub-account" while allowing others to access each profile separately.

## Benefits of Profiles

1. **Isolate applications from different customers**  
   If you have two profiles and one reaches its service limits, only that profile will be impacted or blocked; the other will remain unaffected.

2. **Grant restricted access for external individuals**  
   Allow external users limited access to specific applications and organizations.

3. **Track cost of individual applications and customers**  
   Visualize cost breakdown per Profile and Services on the [Statistics](../billing/billing-summary) page.

## Switching Profiles

To switch profiles, click the current profile shown on the top left and select another one.

## Transferring Profiles Between TagoIO Accounts

Once you request a transfer, our support team will assist you with the next steps. When you submit a profile transfer request, a support ticket is automatically created, and our team will contact you by email to confirm required information and prerequisites before proceeding with the transfer. The process is manual and may take a few hours to complete.

Profile transfer is available for Starter and Scale accounts. Check the pricing page for more information: https://tago.io/pricing/

### Adding Profiles

Go to your account, select **[Profiles & Teams](https://admin.tago.io/profile)** from the list, and click on **Add Profile**.

After that, you can edit the profile to change the name, logo, and upgrade services & add‑ons for it. Each profile starts with certain services included; you can increase the limits as you scale up the applications that run on that profile.

### Renaming Your Profiles

Navigate to your **[Profiles & Teams](https://admin.tago.io/profile)** page and select the **Profile** tab. Click on the profile name, type a new one, and click **Save** to finalize your changes. It is possible to use the exact same name for multiple profiles.

### Sharing Profiles with Teams

Add others to your profiles by adding their e‑mails in the team section. To invite someone, go to the specific profile, select the **Team** tab, and add the user’s email. Make sure that the person already has a TagoIO account before inviting them.

### Generating Account Tokens

1. Click on the **Tokens** tab.  
2. Add a name, permission, expiration, and click **Generate Token**.  
3. Insert your password.  
4. Click **Generate my token**.

These tokens are used to authenticate requests in the TagoIO API for creating devices, buckets, dashboards, sending data, and more.

You can grant access to other TagoIO accounts to any of your [Profiles](../account/profiles) by using the Team feature. By adding other accounts to your team, they will have access to all applications that run on that Profile.

## Invitation notification
The invitation can only be sent to email addresses that already have a TagoIO account. If the invited user doesn't have an account, the invitation email will guide them to create one.  
Once you invite a team member, they can accept the invitation by clicking on the link in the email or via the push notification displayed in the Admin panel. The invitation is valid for 7 days; after that it expires and another one must be sent. You will receive an email and push notification if the invitation was accepted or declined. After accepting, the new member can access the shared profile by clicking on the profile selection button. Shared profiles are marked with a tag.

## Plan limits
The number of members you can invite to a Profile depends on your current plan. Check the list of features and limits available for each plan [here](../billing/account-plans).

## Removing access
You can remove any granted access at any time by removing the user's email from the team members list.

> Only the owner of the [Profile](../account/profiles) is able to invite members.

Each time a device sends data to TagoIO, the system counts one Data Input Transaction for each variable included in that payload.

These data input transactions are accounted against the Profile where your devices are located.

> Note: You should estimate the maximum number of transactions per month to ensure your Profile has sufficient capacity.

## Viewing limits and usage history
You can visualize the limits and usage history of each service in the Profile tab, located under the [Profiles & Teams](link-to-profiles-and-teams) section of your account.

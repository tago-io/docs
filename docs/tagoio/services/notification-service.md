Each time a push notification message is sent by an Action or Analysis function, it is counted as one Notification unit.

## Overview
- The service limit defined in each Profile determines the maximum number of notifications that can be sent during a one-month period (based on your billing cycle).
- Each push notification is limited to 140 characters.
- Messages will appear in the mobile app and the browser when end users receive notifications through your RUN application.

## Usage and Billing Notes
> **Info:** If the Notification service limit is exceeded, no notifications for that Profile will be sent until the limit is increased or the billing period ends.

> **Info:** Notifications sent to your Admin are free and are not counted toward your monthly usage.

> **Warning:** Push notifications not used during the period will not be carried over to the next month.

## Overview

Each time an Email is successfully sent by the [Action](link-to-Action) or [Analysis](link-to-Analysis) function, it is counted as one unit. This limit defines the maximum number of Emails that can be sent from that [Profile](link-to-Profile) during a one-month period. Unused Emails in a billing cycle will not be carried over to the next cycle.

## Important notice

Attention: As anticipated last year, starting on January 1st, 2025, TagoIO will no longer offer native E-mail services. You can still send E-mails by integrating with external providers such as AWS SES directly. Read more: [Read more](link-to-read-more).

## Limits and warnings

- If the monthly Email limit for a Profile is exceeded, no Email will be sent from that Profile until either the limit is increased or the billing period ends.
- TagoIO will send warning Emails each time a service reaches 80%, 90%, and 100% of its limit.

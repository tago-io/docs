When you manage multiple profiles in your account, ensure each profile has the correct allocation of services so they operate efficiently. You can configure per-profile allocations on the Billing page under the [Resource Allocation](link-to-resource-allocation) tab.

The services within each profile can be limited so that when a profile exceeds its allocated limit, only that profile will have its service blocked. If the available services are insufficient for allocation, you can either increase the total service limits for your account or reduce the allocation for other profiles. Access the [Billing](link-to-billing) page to upgrade or change these service limits.

## How to allocate resources
- Open the Billing page and select the Resource Allocation tab.
- For each profile, set the desired limit for each service (for example: Data Input, Data Storage, SMS, E-mail, Push Notification, File Storage, Run Users, Analysis).
- Save the allocation changes. Each profile will then be limited to the amounts you set.
- If you need more overall capacity, upgrade your account from the Billing page to increase total service limits.

See [Resource Allocation](link-to-resource-allocation) for details on the UI and options available when assigning service quotas to profiles.

## Monitoring allocated resources
- The Resource Allocation view shows usage bars for each service per profile so you can track consumption.
- When a profile reaches its allocated limit, only that profile’s service is blocked — other profiles continue to operate.
- Regularly review usage in the Resource Allocation tab to prevent interruptions and rebalance allocations as needed.

## When allocations are insufficient
- Increase the account-wide service limits via the Billing page.
- Or decrease allocations for other profiles to free up resources.
- Choose the option that best fits your account structure and operational needs.

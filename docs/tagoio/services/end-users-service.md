Each end-user added to the User Management list is counted as an end-user. End-users (also called RUN-users) can be added automatically when they sign up in your RUN application.

## Limits and behavior

> If any profile reaches the limit of end-users allocated to it, the system will block the addition of new users.

When a profile hits its allocated end-user limit, no additional users can be added under that profile until the limit is increased.

## Increasing end-user capacity

Increase the number of end-users allowed in your application by [Allocating Resources to profiles](link-to-allocating-resources-to-profiles).

Using this article, you will learn how to integrate a LoRaWAN device with the Senet Network and TagoIO.

> Note: This setup is for the uplink operation â€” data sent from the device to your TagoIO account.

The integration is accomplished in two parts:
1) TagoIO Setup  
2) Senet Portal Setup

## 1) TagoIO Setup

First, go to the [Devices](../devices/devices) module in our admin, look for Senet, and select it.

## Overview
The TagoIO admin interface used for developing applications is displayed only in English. However, users who access your RUN application can view it in any language you configure in your [Dictionary](link-to-dictionary). These users are referred to as "RUN users."

## Most commonly used languages
Some of the most commonly used languages for RUN applications include:

- English
- Spanish
- German
- French
- Italian
- Japanese
- Portuguese

## How end-users choose a language
All end-users can select their preferred language from the "Visualization Preferences" tab on the Account Setting page.

> **Warning:** Make sure that your current plan allows the [deployment of multi-language](link-to-deployment-of-multi-language) for your end-users.

By default, all files are uploaded with Public access. This lets you copy a file's link and easily share it with someone.

> Remember to always set your files to Public if you plan on using them inside widgets.

## Drag and Drop

If you do not wish to manually select the files, you can drag-and-drop them into a specific folder or into the main panel.

## Folders

Folders can be created before you upload your files. Simply press the

After you select the desired files, they will be uploaded to the current folder being viewed. If you wish to upload the files to another folder, simply access that folder and upload the files there.

If you uploaded the files in the wrong folder, simply select all of them and drag‑and‑drop them to the correct folder, or right‑click them and select the option **Move**.

The Custom Domain & Whitelabel add-on lets you promote your organization's brand using a custom URL for your Run portal. Configuring your Custom Domain is straightforward, but there are a few requirements to make it work.

## Pre-requisites

Before configuring your Custom Domain in your Admin, ensure you have:

- A domain or a sub-domain for your organization; you can obtain one from any domain provider. Ensure you can edit the DNS (Domain Name System) records for your custom domain in the domain provider's settings.
- The Custom Domain & Whitelabel add-on is activated in your profile. Check the Pricing page for more information (see [Custom Domain & Whitelabel](../custom-domain-whitelabel) and [Pricing](https://tago.io/pricing)).

> Note: The Custom Domain & Whitelabel add-on is available per profile. If you need to use a custom domain in another profile, you will need to acquire another add-on.

## Adding your Custom Domain

To configure the Custom Domain add-on for your profile:

1. Access your Run module.
2. Click the Domain tab.
3. Paste your domain and sub-domain in the respective fields.

You can also configure the e-mail domain for messages sent from your application, choosing between the available options shown in the Domain tab of the Run module.

The navigation bar is a section of your [Run portal](../tagorun/tagorun-mobile-app) that lets end users easily navigate between pages and access their account information. The bar appears at the top of the Run portal for convenient visibility and can be customized to match your brand by adding your logo, choosing colors for the bar, text, and icons, and adding extra items to the user menu.

## Your logo & colors

You can add your company's logo by accessing the [Run module](../tagorun/run-module) and inserting the URL of your image in the [Main Configuration](run-theme) section. This will apply the logo to the navigation bar and to signup pages. For more advanced customization, you can set a distinct logo for the navigation bar or implement dynamic logos based on [Run User Tags](../tagorun/tagorun-mobile-app).

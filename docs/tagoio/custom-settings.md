Custom Settings is a feature that lets you create unique visualization preferences for your end-users that extend beyond TagoRUN's default settings. After you configure custom settings, they will appear in your end-users' Account Settings.

With Custom Settings you can tailor preferences to specific needs â€” for example, selecting preferred units for visualizing temperature and distance, or choosing decimal, date, and time formats. These settings can be used together with [Dynamic Formulas](link-to-dynamic-formulas) to ensure displayed data matches user expectations.

## Where these settings appear
Custom Settings are visible to end-users in their Account Settings under the Visualization Preferences tab. The example below highlights the Preferences area where unit choices (Temperature Unit, Distance Unit) are exposed to the user.

## Notes
- After you set up Custom Settings, they are available to end-users in their Account Settings and affect how data is displayed across TagoRUN interfaces.
- Consider pairing Custom Settings with [Dynamic Formulas](link-to-dynamic-formulas) when you need data units or formats to be recalculated or reformatted dynamically.

Analysis lets you run custom code inside TagoIO to process data in real time, call thirdâ€‘party APIs, and work with your TagoIO resources.

Common things people do with Analyses:
- Convert units and run math on variables
- Write new values into other devices
- Read across devices to correlate events
- Send email, SMS, or webhooks, or push data back to a device or dashboard
- Automate user workflows to create devices, read files, and manage user tags

Analyses can be triggered by Actions (schedule or condition), by Dashboard UI elements, or by external services through API endpoints. They provide a straightforward way to plug your application logic into the rest of your solution.

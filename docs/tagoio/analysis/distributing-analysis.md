You can create a copy of your analysis and send a link to anyone so they can add a copy to their account through a customized install page. Recipients can edit the analysis as they wish.

> Others will be able to edit the analysis that they received without impacting yours.

When other users access the link you sent, they will see a screen like the one shown below. The images and text on that install page are fully customizable.

To distribute an analysis, first click in the analysis menu of your admin panel, then select the desired analysis.  
Now head over to the distribute section of your analysis by clicking on the **Distribute** tab.

The **Distribute** function relies on creating a customized install page for anyone to install a copy of your analysis. To tailor this page you can modify the title, logo and main image in the corresponding fields. At the bottom of the page there is also a section where you can set values for the copyâ€™s environment variables; these default to the values defined in your own environment but can be changed without affecting your original settings.

After making your adjustments click the **Build template** button to save the information and build the page. The first time you do this, a new section will appear with the link that you can share. All you have to do is click the **Copy** button or manually copy the link and distribute it to anyone you would like.

It is always a good idea to access the link yourself before sharing to ensure the customized install page meets your standards.

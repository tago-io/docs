You can create a copy of your analysis and send a link to anyone so they can add a copy to their account through a customized install page. Recipients can edit the analysis as they wish.

> Others will be able to edit the analysis that they received without impacting yours.

When other users access the link you sent, they will see a screen like the one shown below. The images and text on that install page are fully customizable.

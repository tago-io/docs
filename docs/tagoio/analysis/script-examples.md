TagoIO provides a list of script examples to help you learn how to use the Analysis service. These examples show how to get and insert data into a device's data storage, send emails, execute calculations, and perform other useful tasks that can be added to your applications.

## Accessing the examples
To access the examples, [create one Analysis](/docs/tagoio/analysis/creating-analysis.md) and go to the "Analysis" tab. There you will find the option to **Load a snippet**.

After selecting one example, the code will be added to the body of the script screen.

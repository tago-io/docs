With the script editor, developers can create and edit their own scripts at TagoIO. These scripts are executed according to the configuration defined in the Analysis section.

To use the script editor, go to [Analysis](/docs/tagoio/analysis/), then create or edit an analysis. Set the name, interval, and choose to run it at TagoIO.

:::warning

The editor tab is only shown when you choose to run the script at TagoIO.

By clicking the Analysis tab, you can open the editor. From there you can:
- Load scripts from your computer
- Download scripts from the editor
- Choose from one of our snippet examples

When you save the script, it will be deployed on TagoIO servers. You can then click **Run** to execute it immediately and view the results in the console below.

Use the console to monitor the variables and status of your script. You can see any error or text generated by console.log (or context.log). This console is a simple and useful debugging tool.

## Console UI

![Console view showing the Console tab and Clear Console button](/docs_imagem/tagoio/console-for-debug-2.png)

- Tabs available: General Information, Environment variables, Console, Examples, Tags, More.
- Console area: displays errors and any output generated by your script.
- Clear Console button: clears all output shown in the console area.

## How it works

1. Console screen: Any error or response generated by console.log (or context.log) will appear here.
2. Clear Console: clears everything currently shown in the console screen.

## Example

Use console.log in your Analysis script to write to the console:

```javascript
console.log('Debug message:', myVariable);
```

Use the console to monitor the variables and status of your script. You can see any errors or text generated by console.log (or context.log). This console is a simple and useful debugging tool.

## Console UI

- Console Area: displays errors and any output generated by your script.
- Clear Button: clears all output shown in the console area.
- Download Button: downloads the console output as a text file.

:::tip 
The **TagoAI Assistant** can also be used to debug your script by asking about errors or unexpected behavior using the Analysis console.

## How it works

1. Console Screen: any errors or responses generated by console.log (or context.log) will appear here.
2. Clear Console: clears everything currently shown in the console screen.
3. Download Console: downloads the console output as a text file.

## Example

Use console.log in your Analysis script to write to the console:

```javascript
console.log('Debug message:', myVariable);
```

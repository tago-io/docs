## Automating and scaling your deployment
When you are ready to scale up your application, you can [create scripts](link-to-create-scripts) to automate the [device](link-to-device) registration, the [dashboard](link-to-dashboard) creation, and the association between devices and users.

## Bulk device creation
You can also use the option "Bulk Devices Upload" to create multiple devices at once by uploading a .csv file.

## Overview

Through a TagoIO middleware, companies can connect devices that use their own protocols. The middleware acts as a protocol converter from any transport type (for example, TCP/IP, UDP, etc.) to the standard TagoIO APIs.

For more detailed steps on implementing middleware, see [Creating a Networks Integration](link-to-creating-a-networks-integration).

Also review the tutorial available in the TagoIO [community](link-to-community) to get your network up and running.

## Overview

Through a TagoIO middleware, companies can connect devices that use their own protocols. The middleware acts as a protocol converter from any transport type (for example, TCP/IP, UDP, etc.) to the standard TagoIO APIs.

For more detailed steps on implementing middleware, see [Creating a Networks Integration](../integrations/creating-networks-integration).

Also review the tutorial available in the TagoIO [community](https://community.tago.io) to get your network up and running.  
**Additionally, follow this step‑by‑step guide:** [How to create your own network to integrate with TagoIO](https://community.tago.io/t/how-to-create-your-own-network-to-integrate-with-tagoio/429).

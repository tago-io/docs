The innovative dictionary feature from TagoIO enables you to improve your application by editing any displayed messages and providing your solution in multiple languages. Use dictionaries to substitute texts across dashboards, widgets, variables, and the RUN application (including the mobile app).

## Translate text messages to any language

Any text present in dashboard frames, inside widgets, variables, and your RUN application (including the mobile app) can be replaced using the dictionary. Create your own dictionary by editing fields (key & value) for each language you want to make available to end users.

Learn how to [set up the dictionary](link-to-setup-the-dictionary).

## Customize texts for the same language

You can also customize text values for the same language to adapt wording for different dashboards, contexts, or user groups.

Refer to [Customize texts for the same language](link-to-customize-texts) for details.

## Overview

If you don't have a real sensor (hardware) to send data through the Internet, you can still try all of TagoIO's features by selecting device simulators that feed data in real time. It's like adding a virtual device.

TagoIO's server provides a continuous stream of data—whether that data is simulated (e.g., bus, truck, freezer) or real (e.g., weather conditions in Raleigh, NC)—through the Simulator network. Data is sent to the device's storage in TagoIO.

On top of the fundamental IoT services provided to run your applications, additional add-on modules are available to customize your application using TagoRUN. Add-ons are applied separately to each of your Profiles.

## Enabling add-ons

In your account, go to [Profiles & Teams](https://admin.tago.io/profile/), select a Profile, and add one or more of the add-ons available for your account.

## Available add-ons

Currently, these add-ons are available:

1. [Custom Domain & Whitelabel](/docs/tagoio/addons/custom-domain/)
2. [Custom Mobile App](/docs/tagoio/addons/custom-mobile-app.md)
3. [Control Tower](/docs/tagoio/addons/control-tower.md)

:::info

- Add-ons are applied per Profile, so each Profile can have a different set of add-ons enabled.

The Custom Domain & Whitelabel add‑on allows a higher level of brand engagement with your end‑users.

## What this add-on unlocks
1. Ability to choose a custom URL for the application  
   - Example: If your company domain is mycompany.com, you can use a Run URL such as portal.mycompany.com.
2. Custom e‑mail domain  
   - Allow outgoing emails from the platform to use your organization’s email domain. Emails sent to users will originate from your domain, not @tago.io.
3. Removal of references to the TagoIO brand

:::info

Custom Domain is not applied to API routes; traces of TagoIO can still be found when inspecting the page using Dev Tools.

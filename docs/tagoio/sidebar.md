The sidebar on the left side of your Run application lets end users navigate between dashboards. You can create buttons for quick access — not only to open dashboards but also to open other pages or to connect a new Wi‑Fi device.

## Customizing the sidebar
You can customize your sidebar settings by accessing the Run module and selecting the Sidebar tab.

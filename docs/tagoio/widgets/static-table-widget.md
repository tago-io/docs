Static tables are tables where each cell represents a different piece of information. A cell can contain fixed text or data from a variable.

## Editing the static table
It is possible to customize the widget color, apply a formula to a cell, edit options, and more.

> This widget also accepts features like metadata, which can be set in your variable data. (See the metadata documentation in the TagoIO help center for details.)

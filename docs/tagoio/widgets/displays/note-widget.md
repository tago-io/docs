## Overview
Note allows you to create text to be displayed in your dashboard. It accepts [markdown](/tagoio/tutorials/markdown-guide.md) formatted text, enabling you to use bold, italic, and list formatting.

Although you can use the Note Widget to add images to your dashboard, we strongly recommend using the [Image Widget](/tagoio/widgets/media-widgets/image-widget.md) instead, because it provides an auto-resize image feature.

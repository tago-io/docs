With the Heat Map widget you can create a colorful layer of bubbles over an image to represent the intensity of variables. Higher variable values produce redder (larger/intense) bubbles, and you can add a heat scale to the layer to show the value range.

This widget also accepts features like [metadata](link-to-metadata), which can be set in your variable data.

## Creating your own

To add the Heat Map widget to your dashboard, choose "Heat map" from the widget list and customize it to your preference. Edit the widget using the options located on the right side of the widget editor.

Push button allows users to select options for different states, similar to a mechanical switch. Developers can configure text or an icon for each state and associate colors with each option.

You can also define an Analysis (script) to run when users change each state â€” see [Analysis](../analysis/analysis-overview).  
This widget also accepts features like [metadata](../data-management/metadata), which can be set in your variable data.

## Creating your own

To add the Push Button widget to your dashboard:
- Choose the Push Button widget from the widget list.
- Customize it to your preference.
- Edit its properties using the options located on the right side of the widget.

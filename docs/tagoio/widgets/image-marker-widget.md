The image marker widget allows you to place pins on images and customize each pin's color, value, and icon. Use it to annotate floor plans, maps, and other visuals with live or historical data.

This widget also accepts features like [metadata](../data-management/metadata) and [groups](../data-management/data-grouping), which can be set in your variable data to alter how the widget behaves.

## Creating your own

To add the widget to your dashboard, choose the Image Marker widget from the widget list and customize it to your preference. You can edit it by configuring the options located on the right side of the widget.

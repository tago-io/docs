Cylinders are simple and useful widgets that visualize values relative to a defined range (with maximum and minimum limits) using a cylinder gauge.

This widget also accepts features like [metadata](../data-management/metadata) that can be set in your variable data. (Refer to the Metadata documentation for details.)

## Creating your own

To add the Cylinder widget to your dashboard, choose the Cylinder widget from the widget list and customize it to your preference. You can edit the widget using the options located on the right side of the widget.

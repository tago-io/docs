Use the Card widget to display the last value of a variable, its unit, and a mini-chart. The Card accepts links so that when users click on it, it can redirect them to another website, dashboard, or tab.

This widget also accepts features like metadata (see the Metadata documentation), which can be set in your variable data.

## Creating your own

To add a Card to your dashboard, choose the Card widget from the widget list and customize it to your preference. Edit the widget using the options located on the right side of the widget.

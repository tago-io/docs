## Adding multiple axes to your chart

To add multiple axes to a chart widget:

2. Under Options, open the Y-axis subsection.
3. Click the Multiple Axes button to add and configure additional Y-axes.

Notes:
- After enabling multiple axes, you can assign different series to specific Y-axes so each series scales appropriately.
- Use the Y-axis settings to configure labels, units, and axis position (left/right) for each axis.

Charts are a powerful way to visualize your data and find insights. The Multiple Charts widget lets you customize colors, apply Formula (../formula), change line shapes (step or smooth), choose whether series are stacked, and more.

> Note: In multiple charts, each variable produces a different chart. In the same widget it is possible to have each chart as an Area Chart (../widgets/area-chart-widget), Line Chart (../widgets/line-chart-widget), Horizontal Bar (../widgets/horizontal-bar-widget), or Vertical Column (../widgets/vertical-column-widget).

This widget also accepts features like metadata (../data-management/metadata) and series (../data-management/data-records), which can be set in your variable data.

## 1. 'Data From' Field

This field allows you to set the device and variable that will be used in this widget.

Charts are a powerful way to visualize your data and find insights. The Multiple Charts widget lets you customize colors, apply Formula (link-to-formula), change line shapes (step or smooth), choose whether series are stacked, and more.

> Note: In multiple charts, each variable produces a different chart. In the same widget it is possible to have each chart as an Area Chart (link-to-area-chart), Line Chart (link-to-line-chart), Horizontal Bar (link-to-horizontal-bar), or Vertical Column (link-to-vertical-column).

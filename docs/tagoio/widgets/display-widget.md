Display is a widget that shows the last value of a variable, regardless of the format of the value (string or number).

You can select one or more variables; each variable will have its own box and will display its most recent value simultaneously.

This widget also accepts features like [metadata](../data-management/metadata) that can be set in your variable data.

## Creating your own

To add the widget to your dashboard, choose the Display widget from the widget list and customize it to your preference. Edit the widget using the options located on the right side of the widget editor.

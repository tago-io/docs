The Frame Settings allow you to adjust the appearance of your widgets by customizing the corners, padding, and shadows, and by toggling the widget's header visibility. These options help your widgets integrate seamlessly with your dashboard's design.

## Accessing Frame Settings
To access the Frame Settings, open the widget's configuration page and find the "Frame Settings" section. There you will find options to customize the appearance of the widget.

### Customizing Rounded Corners
The **Rounded Corners** option lets you soften the edges of your widgets. You can adjust the radius for all corners simultaneously or modify each corner individually by toggling the lock icon button.

### Adjusting Frame Padding
**Frame Padding** controls the space around the widget's frame. By adjusting the padding values, you can position your widgets closer together or further apart. Similar to corner customization, you can set padding for all sides at once or adjust each side separately using the lock icon button.

### Disabling Shadow
If you prefer a flat design or plan to combine widgets, you can disable the shadow effect by enabling the **Disable Shadow** option. This will remove the shadow from the widget, providing a cleaner look.

### Header Visibility Options
By default, widget headers are set to “show always”. You can change this behavior to better suit your dashboard’s design:

1. **Show on hover** – The header (including buttons) appears only when the user hovers over the top part of the widget.
2. **Show only buttons** – Only the configured header buttons and options menu are displayed, without any header background or title.

These settings currently apply to TagoIO web applications; we’re working to extend this functionality to mobile platforms.

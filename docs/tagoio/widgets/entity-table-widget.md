The Entity Table widget enables you to display data in a tabular format using fields from your [Entities](link-to-entities). Unlike the [Static Table widget](link-to-static-table-widget) and the [Dynamic Table widget](link-to-dynamic-table-widget), it does not use data from Devices. The widget lets you incorporate data from one or more entities, apply formulas, set color conditions, and allow end-users to directly modify table values from their dashboard. You can also sort data based on the indexes you've created in your entity.

> **Ensure that appropriate [Access Management](link-to-access-management) permissions are granted** to allow end-users to view the data displayed in the widget.

## Editing the Table

To modify a specific part of the widget, hover over the element you want to edit and click it. Selecting the table header opens general settings where you can:
- Choose the data source entity
- Name the table
- Design the table layout
- Configure header buttons
- And more

Clicking on a column opens column-specific settings where you can:
- Adjust column size
- Allow end-users to edit values
- Apply formulas
- Configure color conditions and other column behaviors

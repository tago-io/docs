You can filter the results displayed on a map to minimize the amount of information shown and help you find exactly what you're looking for.

## 1. Filter using pins' data

In the widget configuration, under Filter options, you can customize the filter and how pins' data will be listed in the table.

The Filter table lists the pins' data that are displayed on the map. You can choose either the device name or a variable value to represent a pin's data. When a row in the table is clicked, the corresponding pin will be centered on the map.

To add a filter, select the Add filter button. There are three ways to filter results:

- By the variable name itself
- By the device name
- By values from a variable

Filtering by values will show all values for the selected variables, but only for the variables you selected.

Once the filter is enabled, a filter button will be displayed on the top left of the map widget.

Keep in mind that list by value in the Filter table only shows the values from the variables, and not the latitude and longitude of positions, for example.

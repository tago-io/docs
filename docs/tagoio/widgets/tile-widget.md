Tiles allow you to simplify how users interact with your dashboards by providing a more intuitive and visually appealing set of options.

Use the Tile widget to display clickable images that redirect users to another website, dashboard, or tab.

## Creating your own

To add it to your dashboard, choose the Tile widget from the list and customize it to your preference. You can edit it.

- **Image link** – Provide a URL for the image that will be displayed in the tile. Acceptable formats include `.svg`, `.png`, `.jpg`, and `jpeg`. Only HTTPS URLs are accepted.
- **Visualization options** – Under the *Visualization* tab you can:
  - Add text at the bottom of the widget.
  - Set the image level from 0 % to 100 %.
- **Clickable link** – In the *Options* tab add a valid HTTPS URL if you want the tile to redirect to another website, dashboard, or tab. Leave this field empty if the tile should not be clickable.
- The widget works for both Normal and Blueprint dashboards.

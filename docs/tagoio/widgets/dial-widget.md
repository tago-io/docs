Dials are one of the simplest and most useful widgets. They make it easy to visualize values relative to a defined range (with maximum and minimum limits).

This widget also accepts features like [metadata](link-to-metadata), which can be set in your variable data.

## Creating your own

To add the Dial widget to your dashboard, choose the Dial widget from the list and customize it to your preference. You can edit it by using the options located on the right side of the widget.

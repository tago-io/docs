## 1. 'Data From' Field

Use the "Data From" field to select which device and variable(s) will feed the Icon widget. This determines which variable values are displayed for each icon instance.

## 2. Conditions

Use conditions to change the icon appearance (for example, colors or visibility) based on the variable values. Conditions let you apply different styles or behaviors when thresholds or specific criteria are met.

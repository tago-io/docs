The Device List widget is a table that dynamically populates with information about your devices, such as names, tags, configuration parameters, and IDs. It cannot access devices' telemetry or sensor data.

## 1. Editing the device list
The Device List works as a dynamic table. You can customize its colors and columns, and apply filters to control which devices appear in the list.

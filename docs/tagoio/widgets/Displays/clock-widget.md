Clock gauges allow you to visualize the time in a specific timezone. The widget can show the timezone, weekday, hour, minutes, and seconds.

![Clock widget example showing timezone, time, weekday, and a dotted-second ring](/docs_imagem/tagoio/clock-widget-2.png)

The outer circle contains 60 dots, with each dot representing one second. When all of the dots turn blue, a minute has passed.

After a full minute, the dots are reset back to empty.

> Note: This widget works for both dashboards, Normal and [Blueprint](/docs/tagoio/dashboards/blueprint-dashboard).


## Time format

This widget displays either the 24-hour or the 12-hour format, based on your account's preferences.

## Timezone

By default, the clock will display the timezone set in your account. To change to a different timezone, head over to the **Timezone** tab of your widget and set a new one there.

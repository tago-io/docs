You can easily integrate your RUN application with Zoho SalesIQ to track and engage users. All you need to do is use your SalesIQ key in the RUN setup.

## Steps to integrate

1. Create an account at https://www.zoho.com/salesiq/

2. Copy the key (only the key value shown after `widgetcode:` in the SalesIQ script).

3. Enable Visitor Tracking for your RUN URL.

4. Then, back to TagoIO, in your [RUN](https://admin.tago.io/run) setup page, under the session Integration> User Engagement, paste the key in the Zoho ID field.

You are now ready to track visitors (your RUN users) using SalesIQ!

You will be able to know who is accessing your RUN, when, for how long, and what type of browser and devices were used. Also, you can enable Chat, Bots, remote screen access, analytics, and add functions to comply with GDPR (cookies disclaimer).

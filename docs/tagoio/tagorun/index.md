The options available in your RUN will depend on your current plan and the add-ons selected. Even the Free plan offers a high level of customization.

## Deploying

Your own platform is deployed in seconds, no need to build and pay for an additional server. Your customers will access the domain assigned for you. Learn how to deploy and brand your IoT solution by watching the video below.

## Branding

Your customers will engage with your brand as they sign up and access the application that contains your logo, colors, and personalized e‑mails.

1. **Company logo**  
2. **Customized sub-domain**  
   1. Your application will be part of the domain `run.tago.io`. For example: `myiot.run.tago.io`  
   2. Complete custom domain. For example: [iot.mycompany.com](https://iot.mycompany.com/)  
3. **Browser favicon**  
4. **Navigation bar colors**  
5. **Signup page edition**  
   1. A small reference to TagoIO is added on the button of the Signup page.  
6. **Side bar button inclusion**  
7. **E‑mail template configuration**  
8. **Geolocation and Wi‑Fi setup**  
9. **Google Analytics and CRM integrations**

> * Buy the Custom Domain & Whitelabel add-on to remove any reference to TagoIO brand and use your own domain and e‑mail.

## How it works with mobile App

Your users can download the free [TagoRUN Mobile App](/docs/tagoio/tagorun/getting-started/tagorun-mobile-app). They will simply need to enter your Run domain the first time they log in. For example, if your Run is `mycompany.run.tago.io`, they will enter “mycompany”, and from there the mobile App will present the colors, logo, and buttons that you saved in the Run configuration.

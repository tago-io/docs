The Run module allows you to create and deploy your solution using a customized logo, colors, URL, signup page, email messages, and more.

Run works synchronized with the [Access](link-to-access) and [User management](link-to-user-management) modules. When you configure and deploy your solution, a domain will be created for your application so that users can sign up.

> Note: By default, your URL may be a subdomain of run.tago.io (for example, mycompany.tago.run) or a fully customized URL using your current company domain (for example, portal.mycompany.com).

With Run you can set up three main things:
1. Your Run (Application portal)
2. Your Sign up page
3. E-mail templates

## Your Run (Application portal)
Go to the [Main Configuration](link-to-main-configuration) and [Domain](link-to-domain) tabs to configure the title and subtitle of your application, add a favicon (browser icon) and logo, and edit the colors used in the navigation bar.

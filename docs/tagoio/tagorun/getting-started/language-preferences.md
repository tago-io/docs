The TagoIO admin interface used for developing applications is displayed only in English. However, users who access your RUN application can view it in any language you configure in your [Dictionary](/docs/tagoio/tagorun/getting-started/dictionaries). These users are referred to as "RUN users."

## Most commonly used languages
Some of the most commonly used languages for RUN applications include:

- English
- Spanish
- German
- French
- Italian
- Japanese
- Portuguese

## How end-users choose a language
All end-users can select their preferred language from the "Visualization Preferences" tab on the Account Setting page.

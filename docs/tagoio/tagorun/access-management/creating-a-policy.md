## Overview
You can create individual policies to securely grant access to specific resources in your account for pre-defined targets.

You create [Targets](../defining-targets) (for example, users) and decide which resource types they can access by assigning [Permissions](../security/defining-permissions) (for example, dashboards).

To do this, navigate to the Access module and click **Add Policy**.

You can manually configure a policy by creating a Policy under the [Access module](../security/access-management).

You can create individual policies to securely grant access to specific resources in your account for pre-defined targets.

You create [Targets](/docs/tagoio/tagorun/access-management/defining-targets.md) (for example, users) and decide which resource types they can access by assigning [Permissions](/docs/tagoio/tagorun/access-management/defining-permissions.md) (for example, dashboards).

To do this, navigate to the [Access module](https://admin.tago.io/am) and click **Add Policy**.

## Automating and scaling your deployment
When you are ready to scale up your application, you can [create scripts](/docs/tagoio/analysis/creating-analysis.md) to automate the [device](/docs/tagoio/devices/) registration, the [dashboard](/docs/tagoio/dashboards/creating-dashboard-tabs.md) creation, and the association between devices and users.

## Bulk device creation
You can also use the option "Bulk Devices Upload" to create multiple devices at once by uploading a .csv file.

## Automating and scaling your deployment
When you are ready to scale up your application, you can [create scripts](../analysis/index) to automate the [device](../devices/index) registration, the [dashboard](../dashboards/creating-dashboard-tabs) creation, and the association between devices and users.

## Bulk device creation
You can also use the option "Bulk Devices Upload" to create multiple devices at once by uploading a .csv file.

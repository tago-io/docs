# Getting Started with TagoIO

Welcome to TagoIO! This guide will help you get started with TagoIO's IoT platform and build your first complete solution. TagoIO is a powerful IoT platform that allows you to connect devices, visualize data, create automated actions, and deploy complete IoT applications.

## What is TagoIO?

TagoIO is a comprehensive IoT platform that enables you to:

- **Connect devices** from any manufacturer or technology

## TagoIO Support Severity Level Definition

In order for your ticket to receive the correct priority, select the appropriate severity level when opening the ticket. The TagoIO Support team recommends following these definitions to avoid delays.

> **Note:** Our team reserves the right to correct any severity level that was incorrectly selected.

Our support team uses the following definitions to classify issues:

### Severity 1 — Critical Impact / Complete Outage
A problem that severely impacts your use of the application in a production environment. This indicates an inability to access your application or perform all critical functions. The situation halts your business operations and **no procedural workaround exists**.

### Severity 2 — Significant Business Impact
A problem where the service is functioning but its use in the production environment is severely reduced. A major feature or function is restricted, and because a procedural workaround is not available, your business is highly impacted.

### Severity 3 — Minor Impact
A problem that causes partial degradation of system performance or a non‑critical loss of application functionality. A workaround is available, and the system remains usable for normal business operations.

### Severity 4 — No Business Impact / General Question
Questions about configuration, feature requests, or general usage assistance. These issues do not affect production operations and have no significant business impact.

If you are going to create your own parser, you need to understand how context works.

When you start writing your own [Payload Parser](../payload-parser/), you can use certain global variables in your code. Think of these global variables as variables you can access anywhere without explicitly creating them, similar to built-in keywords like module or process in Node.js.

> These global variables can vary from simple objects to complex functions or arrays. To see a list of the global variables available, check the Payload Parser tab in the device details.

## Payload parser context (common globals)

| Payload parser context | Description |
|---|---|
| payload* | Content of the message that was sent. It usually is an Array of data or a string. At the end of the parser, the payload content is added to your device. |
| device | Device information containing configuration parameters, tags, device ID, etc. |
| raw_payload | Payload sent in the original request, without changes by any parser. Useful when you want to access the data before it has been changed by a Network parser. |
| timeUtils | [timeUtils library](../payload-parser/-timeutils-library) |
| dayjs** | [Day.js library](https://day.js.org/) |
| console.log** | Show an info message in the [Live Inspector](/docs/tagoio/devices/live-inspector). |
| console.debug** | Show a debug message in the [Live Inspector](/docs/tagoio/devices/live-inspector). |
| console.error** | Show an error message in the [Live Inspector](/docs/tagoio/devices/live-inspector). |

> * This variable must be an [Array of TagoIO data](/docs/tagoio/devices/data-management/sending-data) when the code ends.  
> ** These are functions available to be used in the Payload Parser.

Note: The list above shows the most commonly used globals visible in this article. Additional global variables (which can range from simple objects to complex functions or arrays) are available â€” see the Payload Parser tab in the device details for the complete list.

Data Range & Format is where you define the display format and the value range used by the gauge.

## Range Limits

![Gauge example showing min and max values](/docs_imagem/tagoio/gauge-data-range-format-2.png)

In the Range Limits section you set the minimum and maximum values displayed on the gauge. There are two types of range limits:

- Fixed: The minimum and maximum values of the gauge are static and never change.  
- From Metadata: The minimum and maximum values of the gauge can change based on a metadata property in a variable.

## Fixed

If you want to set a static range on your gauge, choose the Fixed type. Simply specify the minimum and maximum values to define the range shown in the widget.

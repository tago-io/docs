# API Overview

It is easy to connect devices, data sources, or third-party APPs to your account using TagoIO Application Programming Interface (API).

We have a comprehensive set of APIs that gives you full control to manage your accounts, data, devices, dashboards, and scripts. You can use the resources available in the Admin page to create, delete, or edit your accounts and dashboards; however, you can do all the same things directly using API.

Access the [API documentation](https://api.docs.tago.io/).

We follow RESTful principles. Before checking the API documentation, there are some details you should know.

## API Response Pattern

All responses from TagoIO API have a pattern, and you will always receive something like this:

```json
// For success:
{
    "status": true,
    "result": [...]
}

// For warning:
{
    "status": true,
    "result": {...},
    "message": "Warning message"
}

// For failed:
{
    "status": false,
    "message": "Error message"
}
```

**Response Fields:**
- **status**: Always boolean. If your request is successful the response will be true, otherwise it will be false.
- **result**: Can be any object type (that is dynamic object), depends what api endpoint you called for.
- **message**: A message from the server. Usually used when there's any error or warning.

## Security

TagoIO takes the necessary steps to protect your data in the database and also during the communication between our server and your devices.

All communication between the devices, your application, and TagoIO server is performed through **Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)** to avoid the man-in-the-middle and wiretapping attacks.

Although the communication can also be performed with HTTP, TagoIO doesn't recommend it. By doing so will eliminate the security of authentication and encryption provided by SSL/TLS protocols part of HTTPS. Just in case you really need to use HTTP without SSL, all you have to do is to add `_ssl=false` on the header or url query string.

Secret tokens for account and devices are generated by TagoIO system and can be individually managed by the user. Different levels of access can be granted to different users or devices.

**The URL that your device should connect is `https://api.tago.io/data` through Port `443`.**

## Tokens

There are four type of tokens: `Account-Token`, `Device-Token`, `Analysis-Token` and `Middleware-Token`.

You are able to generate all tokens from TagoIO admin or directly using API. The type of token and its expiration can also be defined. Just add them in the header of your HTTP request.

### Token Types and Headers

| HEADER KEY | HEADER VALUE | Usage |
|------------|--------------|-------|
| Account-Token | Only Account Token | Full account access |
| Device-Token | Only Device Token | Device-specific access |
| Analysis-Token | Only Analysis Token | Analysis script access |
| Middleware-Token | Only Middleware Token | Middleware operations |
| Authentication | Any Token (Account or Device) | General authentication |

Check the [usage policy](https://help.tago.io/portal/en/kb/articles/63-usage-policy) based on number of requests per a certain period.

## Regional Endpoints

When making a request to the TagoIO API, you must also specify the appropriate regional endpoint. Check out the available regions here: [API documentation](https://api.docs.tago.io/#intro)

```
https://api.<region>.tago.io/
```

### Available Regions
- **US**: `https://api.usa.tago.io/`
- **EU**: `https://api.eu.tago.io/`

## Getting Started with the API

1. **Choose your authentication method**: Select appropriate token type
2. **Read the API documentation**: Understand endpoints and parameters
3. **Test with simple requests**: Start with basic data operations
4. **Implement error handling**: Use the standard response pattern
5. **Monitor rate limits**: Stay within usage policy limits

You can get an overview of your account's costs for the current month by clicking on the [Summary](billing-summary) tab. This view helps you track the costs of sub-accounts (profiles) that you may use to bill your own customers.

## Views
This page consists of three views:

1. The account cost distributed by type of service and plan in a pie chart.
2. The account cost and the limits by type of service and plan in a table.
3. The allocated resources and the estimated cost of each profile.

> Notice: The estimated cost of a profile does NOT include the cost of the current plan.<br />
> Also, the sum of all profiles plus the plan may not match the overall amount of your account if some resources are not allocated to any profile.&lt;br /&gt;
> Discounts and credits are not included in the summary view.

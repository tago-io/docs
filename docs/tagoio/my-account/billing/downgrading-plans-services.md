You can schedule downgrades in your account for your plan, service limits, and add‑ons.

:::tip

If you change your mind any time before the end of the billing cycle, you can modify or cancel the downgrade.

:::

## Downgrade timing and modification
- All downgrades become effective on the next renewal date.
- Your current subscription and service limits remain active at their current level until the end of the billing period you already paid for.
- You can cancel or modify scheduled downgrades at any time until the end of your billing cycle.

## Multiple profiles (important)
If you have more than one profile, make sure you manually [reduce the resources for each profile](/docs/tagoio/my-account/billing/allocating-services-to-profiles.md) before your next billing cycle to avoid any disruption to your application.

## How to downgrade
To downgrade your billing, click on your account name at the bottom-left menu in your Admin, hover over "Profiles & Billing" and select **[Billing](https://admin.tago.io/account/billing)** option.

## Refunds
See our [Refund Policy](/docs/tagoio/my-account/billing/refund-policy.md).

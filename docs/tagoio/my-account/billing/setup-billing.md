## Configure Billing Information
Once you are on the My Billing page, complete the **Billing Information** tab with the company name, address, and any other details you want printed on future invoices.

- Add credit card information to enable payments.
- Specify the email address that should receive invoices — you can use the email associated with your account or provide a different email.

## Select Services and Account Plan
After completing the Billing Information tab, open the **Services** tab and choose your **Account Plan**.

You may also set limits for any services where you think you'll need more than what is already included with your plan. These limits define the overall resources that you will have available to allocate to your profiles (if you have more than one profile). You can always increase or reduce these limits at any time later on.

### Add‑ons
Optional add‑ons can be selected to enhance your account, though they are not required for a basic setup.

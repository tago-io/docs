## How to delete your account

If you need to cancel your account, go to Account Settings by accessing [My Account](https://admin.tago.io/account/general).

Steps:
- Click on your account name at the bottom-left menu in your Admin and select "My Account".
- Hover over "Profiles & Billing" and select "My Account".
- On the top right corner click "... Account Details" and click the "Delete my account" button.
- TagoIO will delete your account, including all profiles associated with it, and will send a confirmation email when the deletion is complete.

:::warning

All applications and data will be permanently deleted. This action cannot be undone.

## Deleting a single profile, organization, or customer connection

If you only need to delete a single organization or a customer connection tied to a Profile (rather than your entire TagoIO account), you can delete that profile by opening the Profile and using the "More" tab inside your profile. This will remove only that profile instead of your whole account.

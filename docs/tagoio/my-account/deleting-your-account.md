## How to delete your account

If you need to cancel your account, go to Account Settings by accessing [My Account](https://admin.tago.io/account).

Steps:
- Open Account Settings via [My Account](https://admin.tago.io/account).
- In the Account Settings, open the "More" tab and click the `delete my account` button.
- TagoIO will delete your account, including all profiles associated with it, and will send a confirmation email when the deletion is complete.

> Warning: All applications and data will be permanently deleted. This action cannot be undone.

## Deleting a single profile, organization, or customer connection

Note: If you only need to delete a single organization or a customer connection tied to a Profile (rather than your entire TagoIO account), request cancellation of that profile by opening the Profile and using the "More" tab inside the Profile. This will remove only that profile instead of your whole account.

Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your account by requiring more than just your password to sign in. It requires and provides another form of authentication that only you know or have access to.

![Two-factor methods list](/docs_imagem/tagoio/two-factor-authentication-2fa-2.png)

## Available authentication methods
- App Authenticator — a six-digit code generated by an authentication app on your mobile device (for example, Google Authenticator, Authy).
- SMS — a six-digit code sent to your mobile phone via text message.
- E-mail — a six-digit code sent to your account e‑mail address.

:::info

The SMS and E‑mail authentication methods are available only for Starter or Scale plans.

## How 2FA codes work
The second factor is a six‑digit code. That code is either:
- generated by an authentication application on your mobile device (App Authenticator), or
- sent to you as a text message (SMS) or e‑mail.

Once a method is configured for your account, you will be asked to type the six‑digit code:
- when signing in, and
- when generating a new [Account Token](/docs/tagoio/profiles/account-token).

:::tip

You can choose the authentication method that suits you best when prompted by clicking the message "Can't access your two-factor device?"

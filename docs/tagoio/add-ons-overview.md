## Overview

On top of the fundamental IoT services provided to run your applications, additional add-on modules are available to customize your application using TagoRUN. Add-ons are applied separately to each of your Profiles.

## Enabling add-ons

In your account, go to [Profiles & Teams](../account/profiles), select a Profile, and add one or more of the add-ons available for your account.

## Available add-ons

Currently, these add-ons are available:

1. [Custom Domain & Whitelabel](../custom-domain-whitelabel)
2. [Custom Mobile App](../custom-mobile-app)
3. [Control Tower](../control-tower)

## Notes

- Add-ons are applied per Profile, so each Profile can have a different set of add-ons enabled.
- For detailed setup or configuration of any add-on, follow the respective add-on documentation linked above.

Table widgets present your data in a tabular way. You can also allow users to change values in cells, delete rows, and perform other table-related actions.

The following table widgets are available:
- Static Table
- Dynamic Table
- Device List

- Entity Table

## Static Table

A Static Table is a special kind of widget that does not use the traditional variable selector. Instead, you specify a fixed number of rows and columns. This option is useful when you do not want to display historical values for variables and only need a fixed layout of data. Learn more about [Static Table](widgets/static-table-widget).

## User List

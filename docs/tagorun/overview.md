# TagoRUN Overview

TagoRUN is TagoIO's white-label solution that allows you to create and deploy your own branded IoT platform for your end-users. With TagoRUN, you can deliver a fully customized IoT experience under your brand, complete with your logo, colors, domain, and user management.

## What is TagoRUN?

TagoRUN is a powerful module that works in perfect synchronization with TagoIO's [Access Management](https://help.tago.io/portal/en/kb/articles/183-access-management) and [User Management](https://help.tago.io/portal/en/kb/articles/190-user-management) systems. When you configure and deploy your solution, a dedicated domain is created for your application, allowing users to sign up and access your IoT platform seamlessly.

# Security and Protection

Security and protection in access management involves implementing comprehensive measures to safeguard your TagoRUN application, user data, and system resources from unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats.

## Overview

Security and protection work hand-in-hand with access management to create a robust security framework. While access management controls who can access what, security and protection ensure that these controls are effectively implemented and monitored.

## Multi-Layered Security Approach

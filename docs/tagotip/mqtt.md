# TagoTiP over MQTT

:::info Coming Soon
MQTT transport support is currently under development. Check back soon for updates.
:::

TagoTiP MQTT leverages the MQTT publish/subscribe messaging protocol for IoT-optimized communication with TagoIO. MQTT is designed for constrained devices and unreliable networks, making it one of the most popular choices for IoT applications.

## When to use MQTT

- Devices with intermittent connectivity
- Publish/subscribe messaging patterns
- Scenarios requiring Quality of Service (QoS) levels
- Low-bandwidth, high-latency networks

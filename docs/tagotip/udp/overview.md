# TagoTiP UDP

:::info Work in Progress
This documentation is currently being developed. Check back soon for updates.
:::

## Overview

TagoTiP UDP provides a lightweight, connectionless transport for sending data to TagoIO. UDP is ideal for scenarios where low latency and minimal overhead are more important than guaranteed delivery.

## When to Use UDP

- High-frequency sensor data where occasional packet loss is acceptable
- Battery-powered devices that need to minimize power consumption
- Fire-and-forget telemetry data
- Scenarios where network bandwidth is limited

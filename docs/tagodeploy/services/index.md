# Services

The **Services** page enables you to configure and assign additional features to
your projects. Integrating services allows you to extend and tailor your
project's functionality to meet specific requirements.

## Overview of Services

Services are modular components that add advanced capabilities to your projects.
Currently, the following service types are available:

- **Middleware**: Connect your project with external platforms—such as LoRaWAN
  LNS—to facilitate seamless data integration and exchange.
- **MQTT Broker**: Deploy a fully integrated MQTT broker within your project,
  enabling device connectivity and communication using the MQTT protocol.

## Service Categories

### Middleware

Middleware services function as intermediaries between your project and
third-party systems. They are typically used to integrate with platforms like
LoRaWAN LNS, supporting bi-directional data flow between your project and
external environments.

### MQTT Broker

The MQTT Broker service provisions an MQTT broker instance within your project.
This service allows you to connect IoT devices and manage data transmission
using the MQTT protocol, supporting both data ingestion and distribution.

## Using Services

To utilize services within your project, follow these steps:

Begin by browsing the list of available services on the Services page. Once you
identify a service that aligns with your project needs, select it to review its
features and configuration options. After selection, assign the service to your
desired project to activate its functionality.

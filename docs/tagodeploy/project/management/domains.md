# Domain Management

The Domains section provides centralized management of all network domains
associated with your project, including those for TagoIO Admin, TagoRun
applications, APIs, middleware services, and MQTT brokers. This interface
enables project owners to view, configure, and monitor the domains that serve as
entry points for various services within the project infrastructure. The domain
list displays essential details such as the domain URL, routing target,
destination, and operational status.

**Important:** Middleware domains are visible and configurable only by project
owners. Collaborators do not have access to view or modify middleware domains,
ensuring that sensitive routing and service configurations remain secure.

## Understanding Domains

Domains are network addresses that allow users and systems to access different
components of your project. Each domain is mapped to a specific service or
application, providing a clear and organized structure for managing access and
connectivity.

The main types of domains managed in this section include:

- **TagoIO Admin Domains**: Provide access to your project's administrative
  interface.
- **TagoRun Domains**: Serve as URLs for your TagoRun applications, enabling
  user access to custom interfaces.
- **TagoIO API Domain**: Defines the network endpoint for interacting with the
  TagoIO API.
- **Middleware Domains**: Route traffic to middleware services integrated with
  your project.
- **MQTT Broker Domains**: Specify network addresses for MQTT broker
  connections, supporting IoT device communication.

## Domain Information

For each configured domain, the domain list displays the following attributes:

- **URL**: The full web address or endpoint that users or systems will use to
  access the service.
- **Target**: The specific service, component, or environment to which the
  domain is mapped.
- **Routed To**: The backend destination where incoming traffic is directed.
- **Status**: The real-time operational state of the domain (e.g., active,
  pending, error).

This information enables efficient management and troubleshooting of network
routing and service access.

## Creating and Configuring a New Domain to a Profile

To add a new domain to your project, follow these steps:

1. Head to the TagoDeploy console and go to your project's **Domains** section.
2. **Set the Subdomain:** Enter the desired prefix (e.g., `admin`, `api`,
   `mqtt`) to use as your subdomain.
3. **Enter Your Main Domain:** Type in your primary domain (e.g.,
   `yourcompany.com`).
4. **Choose the Destination:** Select the service or component (such as TagoIO
   Admin, TagoRun, API, middleware, or MQTT broker) that the domain should point
   to.
5. Click **Add Domain** to create your new domain entry.
6. Next to the domain you just added, click the three-dot menu and select **Edit
   Domain**.
7. **Copy the Endpoint and SSL Certificate CNAME records** provided, then add
   these records to your DNS providerâ€™s settings.

8. Wait a few minutes for DNS propagation. You can check the status by clicking
   **Check Records**.
9. Once the DNS is set up, copy the URL from the domain list and open the Run
   module in your TagoIO Profile and add the new domain under the **Domain**
   section.

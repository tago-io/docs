Collaborators are users who can access and work on your TagoDeploy Project. They
can view and edit project resources but cannot delete the project. Collaborators
are different from Admin Portal developers, which you manage separately under
[TagoIO Admin Accounts](/docs/tagodeploy/project/configuration/accounts.md).

A collaborator must have their own TagoDeploy account to accept an invitation.

## Permissions and Limits

- Can view and edit project resources
- Cannot delete the project
- Cannot manage billing
- Cannot access your Admin Portal unless they have an Admin Account there

Project owners can remove collaborators at any time.

## Inviting Collaborators

Use the Invite action on the Collaborators page and enter the email address of
the user you want to add. The email must match an existing TagoDeploy account.

Invitation states:

- Pending: Invitation sent, not yet accepted
- Accepted: User joined the project

The Accounts section provides a centralized interface for managing all developer
accounts within your project's TagoIO Admin console. Through this interface,
TagoDeploy administrators can view, create, modify, and remove developer
accounts, as well as monitor account status, login activity, and creation dates.
Each account represents an individual user who has been granted administrative
privileges within the TagoIO Admin environment, with no limit on the number of
accounts that can be added to a project.

To learn more about what TagoIO developers can access through the Admin console,
visit the
[TagoIO Help Center](https://help.tago.io/portal/en/kb/articles/211-editing-accounts-details).

When a new account is added, the user receives full permissions to manage their
assigned profile within the TagoIO Admin console. Note that developer accounts
are separate from TagoDeploy accounts. Access to the TagoDeploy console is
managed independently, to grant access, you must add collaborators to your
project.

If a user needs to change their password, they should click the "Forgot
password" button on the sign-in page of the TagoIO Admin console. This initiates
the password reset process, allowing users to securely update their credentials.

For any additional questions regarding the TagoIO Admin console, it is
recommended to consult the
[TagoIO Help Center](https://help.tago.io/portal/en/kb/tagoio). The Help Center
provides comprehensive documentation and troubleshooting guidance for all
aspects of the TagoIO Admin console, making it a valuable resource for resolving
common problems and learning more about available features.

## Managing Accounts

### Creating a New Account

To create a new user account:

1. Click the "Create" button in the top-right corner of the accounts section
2. Fill in the required account information in the "New account" form.
3. Click "Confirm" to create the account, or "Cancel" to discard the changes
4. The new account will be added to the accounts list and the user can access
   the project

### Editing an Account

To modify an existing account:

1. Locate the account in the accounts list
2. Click on the three-dot menu next to the account
3. Select "Edit" or the appropriate modification option
4. Update the account information or access as needed

### Account Management Options

Using the three-dot menu, you can perform various account management actions:

- **Edit Account**: Modify account information and settings
- **Deactivate/Activate**: Change the account's active status
- **Delete Account**: Delete the account from the project

## Profile Sharing

Each new account is provisioned with a unique profile that defines the userâ€™s
access scope and available resources. To enable multiple users to share access
to a specific profile, you should use the
[TagoIO Teams](https://help.tago.io/portal/en/kb/articles/106-sharing-your-profile)
feature. This approach allows for collaborative access while maintaining
appropriate access controls and audit trails.

## Account Information

The accounts list presents detailed information for each administrator,
including the display name, associated email address, account status, last login
timestamp, and the date the account was created. This comprehensive overview
helps administrators maintain control over access and monitor user activity
within the TagoIO Admin console.

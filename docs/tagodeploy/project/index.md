  endpoint for each project.
- **Access Project Console**: Click the platform button to be redirected to the
  project's admin console.

  management page, where you can update settings, resources, and more.

  main features without extra navigation.

you to:

1. **Start New Initiatives**: Launch new projects as your needs grow.
2. **Configure Regions and Settings**: Specify important parameters such as
   region and initial configurations during project creation.

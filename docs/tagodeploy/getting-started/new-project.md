# Home

Welcome to your Home page. Here, you can quickly access your projects, stay
updated with recent messages, and find support resources.

## Create your First Project

Create your first project by clicking on the "Deploy your first project" link in
the home page. If you need a specific Middleware or a MQTT Broker to receive
data from your devices, you can enable them in the services page once you've
created a project.

## What Youâ€™ll Find on the Home Page

The Home page is organized into three sections:

1. **Project List** View all your current projects at a glance.

2. **Recent Messages** Stay informed with a list of the 5 most recent emails
   containing announcements that have been sent to your email.

3. **Support Card** Need help? Easily access support resources and connect with
   the TagoIO Community.

## Help & Support

If you need assistance or want to connect with other users, visit the
[TagoIO Community](https://community.tago.io) for support, discussions, and
resources.
